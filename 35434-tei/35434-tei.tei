<head>PREFACE</head>

<p>
Some of the following sketches do not now appear for
the first time; but such as have been before published
in other form have been entirely re-written,
and, in great measure, recast.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
To the writer the work has afforded an occasional
distraction from more serious professional work, and
he cannot wish better than that it should serve the
same purpose to the reader.

<p>
There exists a class of generously-minded folk who
display a desire to improve their fellow-creatures
and a love for their species, by referring pointedly to
others for the purpose of mentioning that the objects
of their remarks have never been guilty of certain
enormities: a critical process, which is about equivalent
to tarring an individual, but, from humanitarian
considerations, omitting to feather him also. The
<pb n='2'/><anchor id='Pg002'/>ordeal, as applied to others, is unwarrantable; but
there is a certain odd pleasure in subjecting oneself
to it. Now, it is but a paraphrase to say that the
more we go about, the more, in all probability, shall
we be strengthened in the conviction that the paradise
of fools must have a large acreage. The average
Briton has a constantly present dread that he is likely
to do something to justify his admission into that
department of Elysium. The thought that he has
so qualified, will wake him up if it crosses his mind
even in a dream, or make his blood run cold—whatever
that may mean—in his active state. Thus it
falls out that he is for ever, as it were, conning over
the pass-book of his actions, and marvelling how
few entries he can find on the credit side, as he
does so. It is asserted as a fact (and it were hard
to gainsay the sentiment), that <hi rend='italic'>Litera scripta manet</hi>.
No doubt; but how much more obtrusively true is it
that printed matter is as indestructible as the Hydra?
It has occurred sometimes to the writer, on very,
very sleepless nights, to take down from a shelf, to
slap the cover in order to get rid of a considerable
amount of dust, and to peruse, in a volume well-known
to all members of the Alpine Club, accounts written
years before, of early mountain expeditions. To trace
in some such way, at any rate to search for, indications
of a fancied development of mind has a curious
fascination for the solitary man. Effusions which an
<pb n='3'/><anchor id='Pg003'/>author would jealously hide away from the eyes of his
friends, have a strangely absorbing interest to the
man who reflects that he himself was their perpetrator.
</p>

<note place="margin">The survival of the unfit</note>

<p>
We most of us, whatever principles we assert on the
matter, keep stowed away, in some corner or another,
the overflow of a fancied talent. The form varies:
it may, perhaps, be a five act tragedy, possibly a
psychological disquisition, or a sensational novel in
three volumes of MS. It is a satisfaction to turn
such treasures out from time to time when no eyes
are upon us, even if it be only to thank Heaven
devoutly that they have always lain unknown and
uncriticised. <q>Il n’y a rien qui rafraichisse le sang
comme d’avoir su éviter de faire une sottise.</q> Of
work done, of which the author had no especial
reason to be proud, a feeling of thankfulness in a
lesser degree may arise from the consciousness that,
if ever recognised at all, it is now, happily, forgotten.
So have these early effusions sometimes amused,
not infrequently astounded, and at the worst have
nearly always brought the wished-for slumber; and
yet in Alpine writings the same accounts were for
the most part as faithful representations as the writer
could set down on paper of impressions made at
the time. It has often occurred to me to ask what
manner of description a writer would give of an
expedition made many years before. How would the
lapse of time influence him? Would he make light
<pb n='4'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>of whatever danger there was? Would the picture
require a very decided coat of varnish to make it at
all recognisable? Would the crudities come out still
more strongly, or would the colours all have faded
and sunk harmoniously together in his picture? The
speculation promised to be interesting enough to
make it worth while to give practical effect to the
idea. Now the expedition narrated in this chapter
was made in 1870, and possibly, therefore, if a description
were worth giving at all, it had better have
been given fresh. We can always find some proverb
tending more or less to justify any course of action
that we may be desirous of pursuing, and by distorting
the meaning of a quotation manage to serve our own
ends. Of all the ill-used remarks of this nature, surely
the most often employed is, <q>Better late than never;</q>
the extreme elasticity of which saying, in the application
thereof, is well evidenced by the doctor who
employed it in justification of his late arrival when he
came on a professional visit to the lady and found the
baby learning its alphabet.

<note place="margin">Sybaritic mountaineering</note>

<p>
When an aquarium was a fashionable resort,
amongst a good many queer and loose fish, we became
familiar with a monstrously ill-favoured beast
called a cuttle-fish: and may have had a chance of
seeing how the animal, if attacked by his physical
superior, resorted to the ingenious plan of effusing
a quantity of ink, and, under cover of this, retreating
<pb n='5'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>hastily backwards out of harm’s way. There are
some, less ingenuous than the Octopus, who retreat
first into obscurity and then pour out their effusion of
ink. But it is more common to use the flare of an
epigram or of a proverb, as a conjurer does his wand,
to distract attention for the moment and divert the
thought current from matters we do not wish to be
too evident. At any rate, I must in the present instance
lay under tribute the author of Proverbs, and
add another straw to the already portentous burden
that they who wish to compound for literary sins have
already piled on his back. Apologising is, however, a
dangerous vice, as a well-known writer has remarked.
The account, though a sort of literary congenital
cripple, has still a prescriptive right to live. Besides
this expedition was undertaken in the pre-Sybaritic age
of mountaineering, and before the later refinements of
that art and science had taken firm hold of its
votaries. What would the stern explorers of former
time have thought, or said, if they had perceived
persons engaged on the glaciers sitting down on camp-stools
to a light refection of truffle pie and cold punch?
Such banquets are not uncommon now, though precisians
with a tendency to dyspepsia still object
strongly to them. In those days, too, mountaineers
were not so much differentiated that climbers were
talked of by their fellows like cricketers are described
in the book of Lillywhite. <q>Jones,</q> for instance, <q>is a
<pb n='6'/><anchor id='Pg006'/>brilliant cragsman, but inclined to be careless on
moraines.</q> <q>Noakes,</q> again, <q>remarkably sure and steady
on snow, fairly good in a couloir, would do better if he
did not possess such an astounding appetite and would
pay more attention to the use of the rope.</q> <q>Stokes
possesses remarkable knowledge of the Alps; on rocks
climbs with his head; we wish we could say honestly
that he can climb at all with his hands and feet.</q>
<q>Thompson, first-rate step-cutter; walks on snow with
the graceful gait and unlaboured action of a shrimp-catcher
at his work: kicks down every loose stone he
touches.</q> Thus different styles of climbing are recognised.
<q>Form,</q> as it is called in climbing, was in the
old days an unknown term, and yet it is probable that
the <q>form</q> was by no means inferior to any that can
be shown now-a-days. The reason is obvious enough
and the explanation lies simply in the fact that the
apprenticeship served in the mountains was then
much longer than it is now. People did not so often
try to ride a steeple-chase before they had learnt to
sit in a saddle, or appreciated that the near side was
the best by which to get up. When this particular
expedition was made (towards which I feel that I am
an unconscionable time in making a start) I had been
five or six seasons in the Alps, during the first two of
which I had never set foot on a snow-slope. There
had always seemed to me from the first, to be so much
absolutely to learn in mountaineering: there is no
<pb n='7'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>less now, indeed there is more, for the science has
been developed, but it seems beyond doubt, that fewer
people recognise the fact. Like most other arts, it
can only be learnt in one way, by constant practice, by
constant care and attention and by always doing everything
in the mountains to the best of one’s ability.
Too many may seem to think that there is a royal
road, and fail to recognise that a plebeian does not alter
his status by walking along this variety of highway.
</p>

<note place="margin">The growth of the climbing craze</note>

<p>
Time rolled on. The fascination of climbing
spread abroad, and it followed with the increasing
number of mountaineers that more and more difficulties
were experienced in attempts to diversify the
sport in the Alps alone, and in emerging from the
common herd of climbers. Then a new danger arose.
The sport grew fashionable—a serious symptom to
its true lovers. Books of Alpine adventure readily
found readers; novels, and other forms of nonsense,
were written about the mountains; accounts of new
expeditions were telegraphed at once to all parts of
the world, and found as important a place in the
newspapers as the Derby betting, or the latest reports
as to the precise medical details of some eminent person’s
internal complaint. Still further did the craving
for novelty spread, and more strange did the means of
satisfying it become. The mountains were ascended
without guides: in winter; by people afflicted with
mental aberration who wore tall hats and frock coats
<pb n='8'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>on the glaciers; by persons who were ignorant of the
laws of optics as applied to large telescopes; in bad
weather, by wrong routes and so forth. Then, too,
set in what may be called the variation craze. This
is very infectious. For those who can see no beauty in
a scene that some one else has gazed on before it is
still a passion. We may still at times, in the Alps,
hear people say, <q>Oh yes, that is a very fine expedition,
no doubt, but I don’t think I care much about
undertaking it; you see so and so has done it;
couldn’t we manage to strike out a different line?</q>
The result is a <q>variation</q> expedition. The composer
when hard driven, and not strongly under the influence
of the Muse, will at times take some innocent,
simple melody and submit it to exquisite torture by
writing what he is pleased to call variations. Sometimes
he will not rest till he has perpetrated as many
as thirty-two on some innocent little tune of our
childhood. The original air becomes entirely lost,
like a sixpence buried in a flour bag, and we may
marvel, for instance, as may the travelled American,
at the immense amount of foreign matter that may be
introduced into <q>Home, sweet home.</q> Even so does
the climber sometimes practise his art. But for one
who entertains a strict respect for the old order of
things, and for the memory of an age of mountaineering
now rapidly passing into oblivion, to write in any
such strain would be intolerable. And so, even as a
<pb n='9'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>theatrical manager when his brilliant play, stolen, or,
as it is generally described, <q>adapted,</q> from the French,
does not run, I may be allowed to raise the curtain on
a revival of the old drama, a comedy in one short
act, and not provided with any very thrilling <q>situations.</q>
The <q>scenarium</q> lay ready to hand in the
leaves of an old journal, which may possibly share,
with other old leaves, the property of being rather
dry. But we are meandering, as it were, in the
valleys, and run some risk of digressing too far from
the path which should lead to the mountain in hand.
There is a story of a clergyman who selected a rather
long text as a preface to his discourse, and finding,
when he had read it at length a second time, that his
congregation were mostly disposed in attitudes which
might be of attention, but which were, at the same
time, suggestive of slumber, wisely concluded to defer
enlarging upon it till a more fitting occasion, and dismissed
his hearers, or at any rate those present, with
the remark that they had heard his text and that he
would not presume to mar its effectiveness by any
exordium upon it. <hi rend='italic'>Revenons.</hi>

<note place="margin">A tropical day in the valley</note>

<p>
In the early part of August 1870, our party walked
one sultry day up the Saas Valley. The dust glittered
thick and yellow on our boots. Many of the smaller
brooks had struck work altogether, while the main
river was reduced to a clear stream trickling lazily
down between sloping banks of rounded white boulders
<pb n='10'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>that shone with a painful glare in the strong sunlight.
The more muscular of the grasshoppers found their
limbs so lissom in the warmth that they achieved the
most prodigious leaps out of sheer lightheartedness;
for they sprang so far that they could have had no
definite idea where they might chance to light. On
the stone walls busy little lizards, with heaving flanks,
scurried about with little fitful spurts, and vanished
abruptly into the crannies, perpetually playing hide
and seek with each other, and always seeming out of
breath. The foliage drooped motionless in the heavy
air and the shadows it cast lengthened along the dusty
ground as steadily as the streak on a sundial. The
smoke from the guides’ pipes (and guides, like itinerant
nigger minstrels, always have pipes in their mouths
when moving from the scene of one performance to
another) hung in mid air, and the vile choking smell
of the sputtering lucifer matches was perceptible when
the laggards reached the spot where a man a hundred
yards ahead had lighted one of these abominations.
</p>

<p>
To pass under the shade of a walnut tree was refreshing
like a cold douche; and to step forth again
into the heat and glare made one almost gasp.
Flannel shirts were miserably inadequate to the strain
put upon their absorbent qualities. The potatoes and
cabbages were white and piteously dusty. Even the
pumpkins seemed to be trying to bury their plump
forms in the cool recesses of the earth. Everywhere
<pb n='11'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>there seemed a consciousness as of a heavy droning
hum. All of which may be concisely summed up in
the now classical opening remark of a well-known
comedy character, one <q>Perkyn Middlewick</q> to wit,
<q>It’s ’ot.</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">A deserted hostelry</note>

<p>
When within a little distance of the hotel I enquired
whether it was worth while for one of the
party to push on to secure rooms. The guides thought,
on the whole, that it was unnecessary, and this opinion
was justified subsequently by the fact that we found
ourselves the sole occupants of the hotel during the
week or so that we remained in the district. It was
the year of the war; ugly rumours were about, but
very few tourists. Selecting, therefore, the most
luxurious apartment, and having given over to the care
of one Franz, who appeared in the character of <q>boots</q>
to the hotel, a remarkable pair of cowhide brogues of
original design, as hard as sabots and much more uncomfortable,
I sat down on a stone slab, in order to
cool down to a temperature that might permit of dining
without fear of imperilling digestion. So pleased were
the hotel authorities at the presence of a traveller that
they exerted themselves to the utmost to entertain
us well, and with remarkable results. I find a record
of the dinner served. There were ten dishes in consecutive
order, exclusive of what Americans term <q>fixings.</q>
As to the nature of nine it was difficult to speak with
any degree of certainty, but the tenth was apparently
<pb n='12'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>a blackbird that had perished of starvation and whose
attenuated form the chef had bulged out with extraneous
matter. Franz, who seemed to be a sort of
general utility man to the establishment, had thrown
off, with the ease of a Gomersal or a Ducrow, the outward
habiliments of a boots and appeared now as a
waiter, in a shirt so hard and starched that he was
unable to bend and could only button his waistcoat by
the sense of touch. The repast over, Franz removed
the shirt front and unbent thereupon in manner as in
person. Assuming engaging airs, he entered into
conversation, disappearing however for short intervals
at times, in order, as might be inferred from certain
sounds proceeding from an adjoining apartment, to
discharge the duties of a chamber-maid. Subsequently
it transpired that he was the proprietor of the hotel.
</p>

<note place="margin">The hut above Fée</note>

<p>
We agreed to commence our mountaineering by an
ascent of the Balfrinhorn, a most charming walk
and one which even in those days was considered a
gentle climb. There are few peaks about this district
which will better repay the climber of moderately high
ambition, and it is possible to complete the expedition
without retracing the steps. There is no danger, and
it is hard to say to what part of the mountain an
enthusiast would have to go in order to discover any:
so the expedition, though perhaps prosaic, is still very
interesting throughout and quite in the olden style.
The solitude at the hotel was somewhat dull, and the
<pb n='13'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>conversational powers of the guides soon exhausted if
we travelled beyond the subject of chamois hunting, I
did indeed try on one occasion to explain to them, in
answer to an earnest request, the military system of
Great Britain. But, with a limited vocabulary, the
task was not easy and, as I could not think of any
words to express what was meant by red tape, circumlocution,
and short service, my exposition was limited
to enlarging on the facts that the warriors of my
native country were exceeding valiant folk with very
fine chests, that they wore highly padded red coats
and little hats like half bonbon boxes cocked on one
side and that they would never consent to be slaves.
Burgener, anxious for some more stirring expedition,
suggested that we should climb the Dom from the
Saas side or make a first ascent of the Südlenzspitz.
We had often talked of the former expedition, which
had not at the time been achieved, and, in order to
facilitate its accomplishment, divers small grants of
money had been sent out from England to be expended
in the construction of a hut some five hours’ walk
above Fée. In answer to enquiries, the guides reported
with no small amount of pride, that the building
had been satisfactorily completed and they were
of opinion that it was ready for occupation. At some
length the process of building was described and it
really seemed from their account that they had caused
to be erected a shelter of unduly pretentious
dimen<pb n='14'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>sions. It appeared, however, that the residence was
equally well placed to serve as a shelter for an ascent
of the Südlenzspitz and we decided ultimately to
attack that peak first. Great preparations were
made; an extensive assortment of very inferior
blankets was produced and spread out in the road in
front of the hotel, either for airing or some other ill-defined
purpose, possibly from some natural pride in
the extensive resources of the hotel. Then they pulled
down and piled into a little stack, opposite the front
door, fire wood enough to roast an ox, or convert an
enthusiast into a saint.
</p>

<note place="margin">How ruin seized a roofless thing</note>

<p>
One fine afternoon we started. The entire staff and
<hi rend='italic'>personnel</hi> of the hotel would have turned out to wish
us good luck, but did not actually do so, as he was
engaged in a back shed milking a cow. Laden with a
large bundle of fire wood, I toiled up the steep grass
slopes above Fée, leading to the Hochbalm glacier.
The day was oppressively hot, and I was not wholly
ungrateful on finding that the string round my bundle
was loose and that the sticks dropped out one after
another: accordingly I selected a place in the extreme
rear of the caravan, lest my delinquencies should perchance
be observed. The sun beat mercilessly down
upon our backs on these bare slopes and we sighed
involuntarily for Vallombrosa or Monaco or some
equally shady place. The guides, who up to that time
had spoken of their building as if it were of somewhat
<pb n='15'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>palatial dimensions, now began rather to disparage
the construction. Doubts were expressed as to the
effects certain storms and heavy falls of snow might
have had on it and regrets that the weather had
prevented the builders from attending as minutely to
details of finish and decoration as they could have
wished. Putting this and that together, I came to
the conclusion that the erection would probably be
found to display but indifferent architectural merit.
However, there was nothing better to look forward to.
<q>Where is it?</q> <q>Oh, right up there, under the big
cliff, close to where Alexander is.</q> In the dim distance
could be distinguished the form of our guide as
a little dark mass progressing on two pink flesh-coloured
streaks, striding rapidly up the hill. The
phenomenon of colour was due to the fact that,
prompted by the sultriness of the day, Alexander had
adopted in his garb a temporary variation of the
Highland costume. A few minutes later he joined us,
clothed indeed, and in a right, but still a melancholy
frame of mind. Shaking his head sadly, he explained
that a grievous disaster had taken place, evidently in
the spring. The forebodings of the constructively-minded
rustics we had left below, who knew about as
much of architecture as they did of metaphysics,
proved now to be true. They had remarked that they
feared lest some chance stone should have fallen, and
possibly have inflicted damage on the hut. Why they
<pb n='16'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>had selected a site where such an accident might
happen, was not at the moment quite obvious, but it
became so later on. Burgener told us that the roof
had been carried away. Beyond question the roof
was gone; at any rate it was not there, and the rock
must have fallen in a remarkable way indeed, for the
cliff above was slightly overhanging, and the falling
boulder, which was held accountable for the disaster,
had carried away every vestige of wood-work about
the place, not leaving even a splinter or a chip.
However, to the credit of the builders, be it said that
they had tidied up and swept very nicely, for there
was no sawdust to be seen anywhere, nor indeed, any
trace of carpentering work. The hut consequently
resolved itself into a semi-circular stone wall, very
much out of the perpendicular, built against a rock
face. The chief architect, evidently a thoughtful
person, had not omitted to leave a door. But it was
easier on the whole to step over the wall, which I did,
with as much scorn as Remus himself could have
thrown into the action when seeking to aggravate his
brother Romulus. So we entered into possession of
the premises without, at any rate, the trouble of any
preliminary legal formalities.
</p>

<note place="margin">On sleeping out</note>

<p>
In the matter of sleeping out, all mountaineers
pass, provided they keep long enough at it, through
three stages. In the early period, when imbued with
what has been poetically termed the <q>ecstatic alacrity</q>
<pb n='17'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>of youth, they burn with a desire to undergo hardship
on mountains. Possibly a craving for sympathy
in discomfort—that most universal of human attributes—prompts
them to spend their nights in the
most unsuitable places for repose. The practical
carrying out of this tendency is apt to freeze very
literally their ardour; at least, it did so in our case.
Then follows a period during which the climber laughs
to scorn any idea of dividing his mountain expedition.
He starts the moment after midnight and plods along
with a gait as free and elastic as that of a stage
pilgrim or a competitor in a six days’ <q>go-as-you-please</q>
pedestrian contest: for those who have a certain
gift of somnambulism this method has its advantages.
Finally comes a stage when the climber’s one
thought is to get all the enjoyment possible out of his
expedition and to get it in the way that seems best
at the time. Now again he may be found at times
tenanting huts, or the forms of shelter which are
supposed to represent them. But his manner is
changed; he no longer travels burdened with the impedimenta
of his earlier days. He never looks at his
watch now, except to ascertain the utmost limit of
time he can dwell on a view. With advancing years
and increasing Alpine wisdom, he derides the idea of
accurately timing an expedition. His pedometer is
probably left at home; he eats whenever he is hungry,
and ceases to consider it a <hi rend='italic'>sine quâ non</hi> that he must
<pb n='18'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>return to hotel quarters in time for dinner. Nor does
he ever commit the youthful folly of walking at the
rate of five miles an hour along the mule path in the
valley or the high road at the end of an expedition,
gaining thereby sore feet and absolutely nothing else.
When he has reached this stage, however, he is considered
<hi rend='italic'>passé</hi>; and when he has reached this stage
he probably begins really to appreciate to the full the
depth of the charm to be found in mountaineering.
</p>

<p>
But I digress even as the driven pig. A miserable
night did we spend behind the stone wall. About
9 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi> came a furious hail-storm: at 10 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi> rain fell
heavily: at 11 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi> snow began and went on till daybreak
about 4 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> At 5 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> we got up quite stiff
and stark like a recently killed villain of melodrama,
when carried off the stage by four supers. By 6 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi>
I had got into my boots. At 9 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> we swooped down
once more on Franz at the hotel at Saas, persuaded
him to relinquish certain scavenging occupations in
which he was engaged, and to resume his post of
waiter. A day or two later we sought our shelter
once more. No luxurious provisions did we take with
us. Some remarkable red wine, so sour that it forced
one involuntarily to turn the head round over the
shoulder on drinking it, filled one knapsack. The
other contained slices of bread with parallel strata of
a greasy nature intervening. These were spoken of,
when we had occasion to allude to them, as
sand<pb n='19'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>wiches. The fat was found to be an excellent
emollient to my boots.
</p>

<note place="margin">The Südlenzspitz</note>

<p>
The Südlenzspitz, though tall, labours under the
topographical disadvantage of being placed in the
company of giants. Close by, on the north side, is
the Nadelhorn (14,876 ft.), while to the south, at no
great distance, the Dom towers far above, reaching
a height of 14,942 feet. In the Federal map of
Switzerland (which is not very accurate in its delineation
of the Saas district), the height of the
Südlenzspitz is marked as 14,108 ft. North and south
from the Südlenzspitz, stretch away well-marked,
but not particularly sharp ridges, the northern being
chiefly of snow, and inclined at a moderate angle.
To the east, a sharper rocky ridge falls away, terminating
below, after the fashion of a <q>rational</q>
divided skirt, in two undecided continuations which
enclosed the Fall glacier. Climbing up by this ridge,
Mr. W. W. Graham ascended the mountain in 1882.
The <q>variation</q> is described as presenting very serious
difficulties. But in our day, the old-fashioned custom
of ascending mountains by the most obviously practicable
way was still in vogue, and we decided, therefore,
to make for the northern buttress. Leaping
over the wall enclosing the ground-floor of our bivouac,
we descended on to the Hochbalm glacier, made our
way across the upper snow basin, and in good time
reached the foot of the slope no great distance south
<pb n='20'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>of the Nadelhorn. The view during this part of the
walk is very characteristic of the range. From almost
any point of view, the traveller is surrounded on three
sides by a clearly marked amphitheatre of very beautifully
formed mountains. On the right, the shapely
little Ulrichshorn rises up in a self-sufficient manner,
like a single artichoke in a vegetable dish. In front
is the mass of the Nadelhorn and Südlenzspitz, while,
looking back, the view of the mountains on the east
side of the Saas valley is one of great and varied
beauty. It must be confessed that these statements
are derived principally from a contemplation of the
map, for, to tell the truth, the recollection of the
panorama we actually saw is rather indistinct. This
much, however, I may record with confidence; that in
all parts of the Saas district, the views struck me,
in a day when I did not very much look at them,
as possessing strong individuality and the greatest
beauty.

<note place="margin">A plea for Saas and Fée</note>

<p>
The Zermatt district may be still more striking,
and they who have no time to visit both, no doubt do
wisely to seek the more hackneyed valley. But for
such as do not look upon guide-book statements as
the dicta of an autocrat, and can exercise a thousandth
part of the independence of judgment they manifest
in the ordinary affairs of life, a brief deviation to the
Saas country will come as a revelation. After the
crowd, dust, and bustle of the highway to the
re<pb n='21'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>cognised centre of the Alps, to turn aside to this
region is a relief, like stepping out of a crowded ball-room
on to a verandah, or gliding away in a gondola
from the railway station at Venice. Look, too, at
the architecture of the great mountains here, and the
spectator will perceive how nature has succeeded to
perfection in achieving what all artists fail in doing;
that is in designing, and in a manner that precludes
criticism, a pendant; and a pendant too to the Zermatt
panorama. The necessary object in the foreground
of the picture—which we all know to be an
hotel—is provided. Who but nature would think of
framing a pure white picture in a setting of the soft
green pastures below, and the deep blue sky above?
but here it is, and it is perfect. Yet the blue of the
sky is repeated in the picture, for the towering séracs
throw azure shadows on the satin-smooth snow slopes
at their feet. Rest, strength, eternal solidity above in
the mountain forms and crags; repose, softness, and
the charm of a brightness below that must yield and
fade before long to gather force for fresh development
and renewal. No need to seek far for a parallel in our
human world. Between the two districts, Zermatt and
Saas-Fée, there is but the difference between the man
who impresses at once by the force of character, and
the man who has to be studied and learned before we
recognise that he is something beyond the ordinary
run of our fellow-creatures.

<note place="margin">We attack the Südlenzspitz</note>
<p>
Before leaving England we had made tolerably
minute inquiries, but had failed to discover any record
of a previous ascent of the Südlenzspitz, though, as
suggested by Mr. W. M. Conway, the mountain may
have been previously climbed by Mr. Chapman. Some
uncertainty, therefore, whether we should find any
traces of previous climbers, gave the required piquancy
to the expedition. We made at once up the slope
for a long rocky buttress, and towards a part of the
mountain down which the guides asserted stones had
been known to fall in the afternoon. This statement
was probably made with a view of encouraging their
charge to greater exertions, for an old sprained ankle
compelled me to the continual necessity of putting my
best foot foremost in walking over difficult places.
Still, the rocks were at no point very formidable, and
progress was rendered somewhat easier by the fact
that no critical companion was with me, so I felt at
perfect liberty to transport myself upwards in any
style that happened to suit the exigencies of the
moment. I had not at that time quite passed the
stage of believing all that the guides asserted with
reference to the climbing capacities of the individual
who pays them for assisting his locomotion, and had
a distinct idea that I mastered all the obstacles in a
particularly skilful manner. They said as much in
fact, but reiterated their compliments so often that I
somewhat fear now that I must frequently have given
<pb n='23'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>occasion for these remarks of approbation; remarks
which I have since observed are more frequently called
forth to cover a blunder than to praise an exhibition of
science. Probably my progress was about as graceful
and sure as that of a weak-legged puppy placed for the
first time in its life on a frozen pond, or a cockroach
seeking to escape from the entrapping basin, for I had
not then developed, in climbing rocks, the adhesive
powers of—say the chest, which longer practice will
sometimes furnish. We were accompanied by a
porter of advanced years whose conversational powers
were limited by an odd practice of carrying heavy
parcels in his mouth. The day before he had carried
up a large beam of wood for the camp fire in this
manner. I never met a man with so much jaw and
so little talk. He had apparently come out in order
to practise himself for the mastication of the Saas
mutton, for at the end of the day he would accept of
nothing but a sum of two francs, for which I was very
thankful. Similar disinterestedness in men of his
class is not often met with nowadays.
</p>
<note place="margin">The art of probing snow</note>
<p>
After awhile we left the buttress of rock and turned
our attention to a snow slope and made our way up its
crest. Here steps were necessary but there was no
particular difficulty, for the slope resembled a modern
French drawing-room tragedy, in that it was as broad
as it was long. We had but to feel that the rope was
taut, and could then look about with security. In good
<pb n='24'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>time we stepped on to the ridge, and a glance upwards
showed that the way was easy enough. We could not
but feel that if we were to achieve the honour of a
first ascent, such honour would be principally due to
the fact that we had subdivided the secondary peaks
of the chain more minutely than other travellers.
The principle has been carried still further in these
latter days, and as any little pale fish that can be
caught and fried is considered whitebait, and any
article that ladies choose to attach to their heads is
termed a bonnet, so any point that can be climbed by
an individual line of ascent is now held to be a separate
mountain. A considerable snow cornice hung
over on the northern side of the arête and great care
was necessary, for the ridge itself was so broad and
easy, that less careful guides might have made light
of it; but Burgener, though he had already acquired
a reputation for brilliancy and dash, never suffered
himself for one moment to lose sight of the two great
qualities in a guide, caution and thoroughness. At
each step he probed the snow in front of him with all
the diligence of a chiffonnier. It followed that our
progress was somewhat slow, but it was none the less
highly instructive. The accurate sense of touch in
probing doubtful snow with the axe requires and
deserves very much more practice than most people
would imagine. The unpractised mountaineer may
climb with more or less ease a difficult rock the first
<pb n='25'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>time he is brought face to face with it, but long and
carefully acquired experience is necessary before a
man can estimate with certainty the bearing power
of a snow bridge with a single thrust of the axe.
Indeed many guides of reputation either do not possess
or never acquire the muscular sense necessary to
enable them to form a reliable opinion on this matter.
As a rule, if the rope be properly used and such a
mistake be made, somebody plunges through, is hauled
out again and no harm is done; but there are occasions
when serious accidents have happened, when probably
lives have been lost owing to want of skilled
knowledge in this detail of snow mountaineering. I
have known guides who never failed when they came
to a treacherous-looking bridge, to give it one apparently
careless thrust with the axe and then walk
across with perfect confidence; and I have seen
others do exactly the same and disappear suddenly
to cool regions below through the bridge; and <hi rend='italic'>vice
versâ</hi>. The unskilful prober will make wide detours
when he might go in safety, and the man of good
snow touch will avoid what looks sound enough: till
in returning, perhaps you see that the hard crust concealed
but rotten things beneath: as in an ill-made
dumpling. It needs no small amount of training
to judge between the man who quickly and with
certainty satisfies himself of the safety of a particular
snow passage, and the man who is too careless
<pb n='26'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>properly to investigate it; yet without such experience
the amateur is not really able to decide whether a
guide be a good or a bad one.
</p>
<note place="margin">Sentiment on a summit</note>
<p>
Here and there along the ridge short rock passages
gave a welcome relief and at length we stood on
the highest point of the ridge which culminates so
gently in the actual peak of the Südlenzspitz. Our
first care was to scrape about and hunt diligently for
traces of any previous party. No relic of conviviality
could be found, and as all the flat stones about
appeared to be in their natural state of disorder, we
piled up some of them into a neat little heap, and
came to the conclusion that we had performed very
doughty deeds. But we were younger then. The
sun was out, there was a dead calm, and we lay
for a while basking in the warmth and planning a
serious expedition for some future year. It may seem
strange in these days of rocket-like mountaineering
when the climber, like the poet, <hi rend='italic'>nascitur non fit</hi>, but
the peak whose assault we discussed was none other
than the Matterhorn. It was no longer thought
that goblins and elves tenanted its crags; but although
these spectres had not yet been frightened away and
turned out of house and home by sardine boxes and
broken bottles, some trace of prestige still adhered to
the mountain. It had not then, like a galley slave,
been bound with chains, or, even as a trussed chicken,
girt about with many cords. Nor was the ascent of
<pb n='27'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>the peak then talked about as carelessly as might be
a walk along Margate pier. Alexander Burgener had
never been up the peak, though he was most anxious
to get an opportunity of doing so. I can remember
well the advice that was given to me on the top of the
Südlenzspitz to practise further on a few less formidable
mountains before attacking the fascinating Mont
Cervin itself. Alas for the old days and the old style
of mountaineering! It may be doubted whether such
discussions often take place nowadays; but then it
was only my sixth season in the Alps. The following
year we did hatch out the project laid on the top of
the Südlenzspitz to climb the Matterhorn together.
To this moment I can remember as I write every
detail of the climb and every incident of the day as
vividly as if it were yesterday; and what a splendid
expedition it was then. The old, old fascination can
never come back again in quite the same colours;
better, perhaps, that it should not. Is it always true
that <q>a sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering
happier things</q>? Surely there is a keenness and a
depth of pleasure to be found in recalling happiness,
though it may never return in its old form; and the
memory of pleasure just toned with a trace of sadness
is one of the most profound emotions that can stir the
human heart. Go on and climb the Alps ye that
follow: nowhere else will you find the same pleasure.
But it is changed, and in this amusement the old
<pb n='28'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>fascination will never be quite the same to you. It
may be, it will be, equally keen, but as there is a
difference between skating on virgin ice and that which,
though still good, is scored by marks of predecessors,
so will you fail to find a something which in the olden
days of mountaineering seemed always present. Go
elsewhere if you will, and seek fresh fields for mountaineering
enterprise in the Caucasus, the Himalayas,
the Andes. There you will find the mountains have
a charm of their own: the mark is as good, but it is
not the Alpine mark. That has been taken by others.

<note place="margin">The feast is spread</note>
<p>
Judging by the nature of these sentiments it would
seem that we must have become pensive to the verge
of slumber while on the summit. In descending, we
followed our morning’s tracks, and scorning the
seductive shelter of the hut made straight down for
the hotel. On this occasion we found Franz, who was
a man of varied resources and accomplishments,
hanging his shirt, which apparently he had just
washed, up to dry. Our unexpected arrival appeared
to disconcert him a little, for the straitened nature of
his wardrobe precluded him, to his great disappointment,
from appearing at dinner in full costume. He
conceived, however, an ingenious, though somewhat
transparent subterfuge, and made believe that he had
got a bad cold in the chest which compelled him to
button his coat up tight round the neck. In honour
<pb n='29'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>of our achievements he said he would go down to the
cellar and bring us up a curious old wine. The cellar
consisted apparently of a packing-case in a shed. Old
the wine may have been; curious it certainly was, for
it possessed a strong heathery flavour and seemed to
turn hot very suddenly and stick fast in the throat
like champagne at a suburban charity ball. But
nevertheless, with the remnants of the blackbird or
some other <hi rend='italic'>rara avis</hi> made into a species of pie, we
feasted royally.
</p>

<p>
A few days later we crossed over to Zermatt by
the Alphubel Joch, a heavy fall of snow having prevented
any idea of making our contemplated assault
on the Dom. A Swiss gentleman of a lively nature
and excessive loquacity accompanied us. He was not
an adroit snow walker, and disappeared on some five
or six occasions abruptly into crevasses. The moment,
however, that he got his head out again, he resumed
his narrative at the exact point at which it had been
perforce broken off without exhibiting the least discomposure.
The subject to which his remarks referred
I did not succeed in ascertaining. We parted at a
little chalet not far from the Riffel, leaving our friend
lying flat on his back on the grass contemplating the sky
with a fixed expression, with his hands folded over his
waistcoat. He may have been a poet inspired with
a sudden desire for composition for aught I know, or
may have assumed this attitude as likely to facilitate
<pb n='30'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>the absorption of a prodigious quantity of milk which
he took at the chalet.
</p>

<p>
As we drew nearer to the odd mixture of highly
coloured huts and comfortable hotels that make up
the village of Zermatt, a sense of returning home
crept over the mind, a consciousness of friends at
hand, of warm welcomes, mixed with the half presentiment
that is always felt on such occasions, that
some change would be found; but happily it was not
so. The roadway was in its former state; the cobble
stones a trifle more irregular and worn more smooth,
but still the same. The same guides, or their prototypes,
were sitting on the same wall drumming their
heels. The same artist was hard at work on a sketch
of the Matterhorn in a field hard by. The same party
just returning from the Görner Grat. The same
man looking out with sun-scorched face from the salon
window and the same click from the self-willed billiard
balls on the uncertain table below. Ay, and the same
unmistakable heartfelt greetings and handshakings at
the door of the Monte Rosa. Churlish indeed should
we have been if we had sighed to think that we had
met our warmest welcome at an inn.

<p>
The writer of an Alpine narrative labours under more
disadvantages than most literary folk—if authors
generally will permit the association, and allow that
those who rush into print with their Alpine experiences
have the smallest claim to be dignified with such a
title. One drawback is that their accounts necessarily
suffer from a paucity of characters. A five-act tragedy
supported, to use a theatrical expression, by two walking
gentlemen, one heavy lead and a low comedy
<q>super,</q> might possibly pall upon an audience, but in
Alpine literature, if I may be permitted to push the
metaphor a little further, not only is this the case but
the unhappy reader finds the characters like <q>barn
<pb n='32'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>stormers</q> playing now comedy, now tragedy, and
sometimes, it may possibly be added, dramas of
romance.
</p>
<note place="margin">Fact and romance</note>
<p>
Again, in all matters absolutely relating to mountaineering
in the Alps, the narrator feels bound
to stick to matters of fact. The drama of romance
must be excluded from his répertoire, or, at any rate,
very cautiously handled. I knew a man once, who
on a single occasion went a-fishing in Norway and
caught a salmon. Naturally he was proud of the
achievement, and when in the company of brother
sportsmen, would hold up his head, assume a knowing
air, and take part in the conversation, such conversation
relating, of course, to the size of the various fish
those present had caught. Such unswerving and
prosaic veracity did my friend possess, that, though
sorely tempted as he must have been on many occasions,
for ten years he never added a single ounce to
the weight of his fish. A writer, an Alpine scribbler
at any rate, is perhaps justified if he introduces
incidents into an account of an expedition which may
not have happened on that particular occasion, but
which did happen on some other; and surely he
may, without impropriety, romance a little on such
part of his work as is not strictly geographical; for
example, he may describe a chalet as being dirty,
when according to the peasant’s standard of cleanliness
it would have been considered spotless, or describe
<pb n='33'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>a view as magnificent, when as a matter of fact he
paid no attention to it, but he would be acting most
culpably if he asserted that he got within fifty feet of
the summit, well knowing that he was not fifty feet
from the base of the peak, or if he stated that rocks
were impossible, or an ice-fall impracticable, when the
sole reason for his failure consisted in his being possessed
with a strong desire to go back home. Of course
a writer can only give his own impressions, and these
are much tempered by increased experience and the
lapse of time, but in taking up old accounts of
Alpine work one not unfrequently finds a good deal
of description that requires toning down. In these
sketches I have striven honestly to render all that relates
intimately to the actual mountains as accurate
as possible, and would sooner be considered a dull than
an unreliable historian.
</p>

<p>
It is no easy matter to reproduce almost on the
spot an account of a climb with absolute accuracy,
however strong the desire may be to do so. Besides,
a climber does not pursue his pastime with a note
book perpetually open before him. If he does, his
mountaineering is more of a business than he is
usually willing to admit. The guide often, the
amateur commonly, fails to recognise exactly from a
distance a line of ascent or descent on rocks, though
but just completed. Still more difficult is it to work
out the precise details of a particular route on a map
<pb n='34'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>or photograph. The microscopist knows that the
higher powers of his instrument give him no additional
insight into the structure of certain objects,
but rather mislead. Even so may my readers be
asked to employ but gymnoscopic criticism of these
sketches.
</p>
<note place="margin">The thirst for novelty</note>
<p>
In September 1872 our party reached Zermatt
from Chamouni by the <q>high-level</q> route, a series of
walks which no amount of familiarity will ever deprive
of their charm, and concerning which more will be
found elsewhere in this work. All Alpine climbers
were then burning as fiercely as they ever did to
achieve something new. They had just begun to
realise that the stock of new peaks and passes was
not inexhaustible, and that the supply was wholly
inadequate to meet the demand. This feeling showed
itself in various ways. Climbers looked upon each
other with something of suspicion and jealousy, and
if any new expedition was being planned by any one
of their number the others would quickly recognise
the state of affairs. If an Alpine man were found
secreted in obscure corners conversing in a low voice
with his guides and intent on a study of the map, or
if he returned evasive answers when questioned as to
his plans, he was at once set down as having, probably,
a new expedition in mind. As for the guides,
they assumed at once airs of importance, as does a
commencing schoolboy newly arrayed in a tall hat,
<pb n='35'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>and exhibited such mystery that their intentions were
unmistakable. Their behaviour, indeed, may have
been partly due to the fact that the natural efforts of
their comrades to extract information was invariably
accompanied by somewhat undue hospitality, and their
brotherly feelings were usually expressed in an acceptably
liquid form. As a rule such hospitality did not
fail in its object. Whether due to a certain natural
leakiness of mind on the part of the guides or not,
I cannot say, but certainly the information always
oozed out, and the intentions of the party were invariably
thoroughly well known before the expedition
actually started to achieve fresh glory. Every one of
the first-rate peaks in the Zermatt district had been
ascended, most of them over and over again, before
1872, but the Rothhorn was still out of the pale of
the Zermatt expeditions. Messrs. Leslie Stephen
and F. Craufurd Grove, who first climbed the peak,
ascended it from Zinal, and descended to the same
place. It seemed to us, therefore, that if we could
prove the accessibility of the mountain from Zermatt,
we should do something more than merely climb the
peak by a new route. The rocks looked attractive,
and the peak itself lay so immediately above Zermatt
that it seemed possible enough to make the ascent
without sleeping out or consuming any great amount
of time.
</p>

<p>
We went through all the necessary preliminary
<pb n='36'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>formalities. We assumed airs of mystery at times;
why, I know not. We inspected distant peaks through
the telescope. At other times we displayed an excess
of candour, and talked effusively about districts remote
from that which we intended to investigate.
We climbed up a hill, and surveyed the face of our
mountain through a telescope, thereby wasting a day
and acquiring no information whatever. We pointed
out to each other the parts of the mountain which
appeared most difficult, and displayed marvellous differences
of opinion on the subject, owing, as it is usually
the case, to the circumstance that we were commonly,
in all probability, talking at the same time about totally
distinct parts of the peak. With the telescope I succeeded
in discovering to my own entire satisfaction a
perfectly impracticable route to the summit. Finally,
in order that no single precaution might be omitted
to ensure success, we sent up the guides to reconnoitre—a
most useless proceeding. We had new
nails put in our boots, ordered provisions, uncoiled
our rope and coiled it up again quite unnecessarily,
gave directions that we should be called at an unhallowed
hour in the morning, and went to bed under
the impression that we should not be object in the least
to turn out at the time arranged.
</p>

<note place="margin">Rock v. snow mountains</note>

<p>
It is on the rock mountains of Switzerland that
the acme of enjoyment is to be found. Not that
I wish to disparage the snow-peaks; but if a
com<pb n='37'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>parison be instituted it is to most climbers, at any rate
in their youthful days, infinitely in favour of the rock.
Of course it may be argued that there are comparatively
few mountains where the two are not combined.
But a mountaineer classifies peaks roughly
as rock or snow, according to the chief obstacles that
each presents. A climber may encounter serious
difficulties in the way of bergschrunds, steep couloirs,
soft snow, and so forth; but if on the same expedition
he meets with rocks which compel him to put
forth greater energies and perseverance than the snow
required, he will set the expedition down as a difficult
rock climb, simply, of course, because the idea of
difficulty which is most vividly impressed on his mind
is in connection with that portion of his climb, and
<hi rend='italic'>vice versâ</hi>. An undeniable drawback to the snow
peaks consists in their monotony. The long series of
steps that have to be cut at times, or the dreary wading
for hours through soft or powdery snow, are not
always forgotten in the pleasure of overcoming the
difficulties of a crevasse, reaching the summit of a
peak, or the excitement of a good glissade. It is the
diversity of obstacles that meet the rock climber, the
uncertainty as to what may turn up next, the doubt
as to the possibility of finding the friendly crack or
the apposite ledge, that constitute some of the main
charms. Every step is different, every muscle is called
into play as the climber is now flattened against a
<pb n='38'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>rough slab, now abnormally stretched from one hold
to another, or folded up like the conventional pictures
of the ibex, and every step can be recalled afterwards
with pleasure and amusement as the mountain is
climbed over again in imagination.
</p>
<note place="margin">The amateur and the guide</note>
<p>
But there is more than this; on rocks the amateur
is much less dependent on his guides and has much
more opportunity of exercising his own powers. It
must be admitted that on rocks some amateurs are
occasionally wholly dependent not on, but from their
guides, and take no more active share in locomotion
than does a bale of goods in its transit from a ship’s
hold to a warehouse. Too often the amateurs who
will not take the trouble to learn something of the
science and art of mountaineering are but an impediment,
an extra burden, as has been often said, to the
guides. The guides have to hack out huge steps for
their benefit. The amateurs wholly trust to them for
steering clear of avalanches, rotten snow bridges, and
the like. The amateur’s share in a snow ascent
usually consists, in fact, either in counselling retreat,
insisting on progress, indicating impossible lines of
ascent, or in the highly intellectual and arithmetical
exercise of counting the number of steps hewn out to
ensure his locomotion in the proper direction.
</p>

<p>
Place the unpaid climber, on the other hand, on
rocks. Here the probability is that a slip will entail
no unpleasant consequences to anyone but the slipper.
<pb n='39'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>The power of sustaining a sudden strain is so enormously
increased when the hands have a firm grip
that the amateur can, if he please, sprawl and
scramble unaided over difficult places with satisfaction
to himself and usually without risk to anyone else;
that is, as soon as he has fully persuaded the guides (no
easy task, I admit) that the process of pulling vehemently
at the rope, possibly encircling his waist in a
slip knot, is as detrimental to his equilibrium as it is to
his digestion. Guides, however, as has been hinted,
do not acknowledge this fact in animal mechanics,
and their employers frequently experience as an acute
torture that compressing process which, more deliberately
applied, is not regarded by some as hurtful,
but rather as a necessary accompaniment of fashionable
attire. When the amateur has succeeded in
overcoming the natural instinct of the guides to pull
when there is no occasion to do so, he becomes a unit
in the party, a burden of course, and a hindrance to
some guides, but nothing to what he was on the
snow.
</p>

<p>
Sentiments similar to the above have not unfrequently
been set forth in print: they seldom, if ever,
actuate the minds of mountaineers when actually
engaged in their pastime or when describing their
exploits to less skilled persons.
</p>

<p>
There is great satisfaction, too, in translating
one’s self over a given difficult rock passage without
<pb n='40'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>other assistance than that provided by nature herself,
and without surreptitious aid from one’s neighbour in
the shape of steps. Then again, snow mountains are
as inconsistent as cheap aneroids. One day each step
costs much labour and toil, and almost the next
perhaps the peak will allow itself to be conquered in
one-tenth of the time. Not that the writer seeks to
argue that there is no pleasure to be derived from
snow mountains. It is to climbing <hi rend='italic'>per se</hi> that these
remarks apply. After all, everyone has his own
opinion; but he who has not tasted the pleasures of
a really difficult and successful rock climb—especially
if it be a new one—knows not what the Alps can
really do for his amusement.

was suggested by the guides, viz. an ascent of the
Rothhorn (or Moming) from the Zermatt side. Mr.
Passingham of Cambridge was at the time staying at
the Monte Rosa Hotel, and it was soon arranged that
we should combine our forces. The guides, on being
asked their opinion as to the projected climb, reported
diplomatically that, given fine weather, the ascent
would be difficult but possible. This is the answer
that the guides generally do give. We decided to
attempt the whole excursion in a single day, considering
that a short rest in the comparatively luxurious
beds provided by M. Seiler was preferable on the
whole to more prolonged repose in a shepherd’s hut;
<pb n='41'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>for the so-called repose means usually a night of
misery, and the misery under these conditions is apt
to make a man literally acquainted with strange
bed-fellows. At 2 in the morning we sought for
the guides’ room, to superintend the packing of our
provisions. It was not easy to find, but at last we
discovered a dingy little subterranean vault with one
small window tightly jammed up and covered with
dust. Of this den there were two occupants. One
was employed silently in eating large blocks of a
curious boiled mess out of a pipkin. The other was
smoking a very complicated pipe, and sitting bolt
upright on a bench with half a bottle of <hi rend='italic'>vin ordinaire</hi>
before him. Why he was carousing thus in the
small hours was not evident. From these signs we
judged correctly that the apartment was devoted to the
guides as a dining, smoking, club and recreation room.
</p>

<p>
Our staff was already in attendance, and it struck
both of us that the success of the expedition was a
foregone conclusion if it depended on the excellence of
our guides—Alexander Burgener, the embodiment of
strength, endurance, and pluck; Ferdinand Imseng,
of activity and perseverance, alone would have sufficed,
but we had in addition a tough, weather-beaten, cheery
companion (for he was always a companion as well as
a guide), Franz Andermatten, ever sagacious, ever
helpful and ever determined. It would be hard to
find a successor adequately to fill our old friend’s place.
<pb n='42'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>It is impossible to efface his memory from my mind,
nor can I ever forget how on that day he showed all
his best qualities and contributed mainly to our
success.<note place="foot">Franz Andermatten died in August 1883. His name is
mentioned elsewhere in these sketches, but I leave what I have
written untouched: for I do not hold with those who would
efface the recollection of all that was bright and merry in one taken
from us.</note> The prologue is spoken; let us raise the
curtain on the comedy.
</p>

<note place="margin">A false start</note>

<p>
The guides had already made their usual preparations
for packing up—that is to say, they had constructed
a multiplicity of little paper parcels and
spread them about the room. As to the contents of
these little parcels, they were of course uncertain, and
all had to be undone to make sure that nothing had
been omitted. A good deal of time was thus lost, and
nothing much was gained, except that we corrected
the error of packing up a handful of loose lucifers and
two tallow dips with the butter and honey in a glass
tumbler. Then the parcels were stowed away in the
knapsacks, the straps of course all rearranged and
ultimately replaced by odds and ends of string.
Eventually, at 3 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi>, we started, leaving the two
occupants of the guides’ room still engaged in the
same manner as when they first came under observation,
and walked up the narrow valley running due
north of Zermatt and leading towards the Trift Joch
and the base of the mountain for which we were
<pb n='43'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>making. Having journeyed for about half an hour,
it was discovered that the telescope had been left
behind. Franz instantly started off to get it; not
because it was considered particularly necessary, but
chiefly on the ground that it is not orthodox to go on
a new expedition without a telescope. We stumbled up
the narrow winding path, and close below the moraine
called our first halt and waited for Franz’s return.
I selected a cool rock on which to complete the slumber
which had been commenced in bed and continued on
a tilted chair in the guides’ room. After waiting an
hour we decided to proceed, as no answer was returned
to our frequent shouts. Presently, however, a distant
yell attracted our attention, and we beheld, to our
astonishment, the cheery face of Franz looking down
on us from the top of the moraine. Stimulated by
this apparition, we pushed on with great vigour,
clambered up the moraine, whose extreme want of
cohesion necessitated a treadmill style of progression,
and having reached the top passed along it to the
snow. Here we bore first to the right, and then,
working round, made straight for a sharp-topped
buttress which juts out at a right angle from the
main mass of the mountain. Arrived at a patch of
rocks near the commencement of the arête, we
disencumbered ourselves of superfluous baggage; that
is to say, after the traditional manner of mountaineers,
we discarded about three-fourths of the
<pb n='44'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>impedimenta we had so laboriously dragged up to
that point, and of which at no subsequent period of
the expedition did we make the slightest use. Next,
we prepared for such rock difficulties as might present
themselves, by buttoning up our coats as tight as
was convenient, and decorated our heads respectively
with woollen extinguishers like unto the covers placed
by old maids over cherished teapots.
</p>

<p>
It is a grand moment that, when the difficulty of
an expedition opens out, when you grasp the axe
firmly, settle in to the rope, and brace up the muscles
for the effort of the hour: a moment probably the
most pleasurable of the whole expedition, when the
peak towers clear and bright above, when the climber
realises that he is on the point of deciding whether he
shall achieve or fail in achieving a long wished for
success, or what it may be perhaps allowable to call a
cutting-out expedition (for even mountain climbers
are prone to small jealousies). The excitement on
nearing the actual summit often rather fades away
than increases, and the climber lounges up the last
few steps to the top with the same sort of nonchalance
that a guest invited to drink displays in approaching
the bar.
</p>

<note place="margin">Falling stones in the gully</note>

<p>
Dividing into two parties, we passed rapidly along
the snow ridge which abuts against the east face of the
mountain. The cliffs of the Rothhorn seem almost to
overhang on this face, and were from our point of
<pb n='45'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>view magnificent. On the right, too, the precipice is
a sheer one, to employ a not uncommon epithet.
Without much difficulty we clambered up the first
part of the face of the mountain, taking a zigzag
course towards the large gully which is distinctly
visible from the other side of the valley, and which
terminates above in a deep jagged notch in the ridge
not far below the summit. Gradually the climbing
became more difficult, and it was found necessary to
cross the gully backwards and forwards on several
occasions. In so crossing we were exposed to some
risk from falling stones; that is to say, some chips and
bits of rock on a few occasions went flying by without
any very apparent reason. In those days mountaineers
were in the habit of considering these projectiles
as a possible source of risk. A later generation
would pass them by as easily as the stones passed by
us, and it is not now the fashion to consider such a
situation as we were in at all dangerous. It is difficult
to see the reason why. Perhaps people’s heads
are harder now than they were then. For the greater
part of the time we kept to the left or south side of
the gully, and reaching the notch looked right down
upon the commencement of the Glacier du Durand, a
fine expanse of snowfield, singularly wild-looking and
much crevassed. Turning to the right, we ascended a
short distance along the ridge, and then a halt was
called. The guides now proceeded to arrange a length
<pb n='46'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>of some hundred feet of rope on the rocks above to
assist in our return. The process sorely tried our
patience, and we were right glad when the signal was
given to go on again. We had now to leave the arête,
to descend a little, and so pass on to the west face of
the mountain, and by this face to ascend and gradually
work back to the ridge. No doubt during this
part of the climb we made much the same mistake in
judgment as had previously been made on a memorable
ascent of the Matterhorn, and crossed far more
on to the face than was really necessary or advisable.
The mountain has since the time when these lines
were originally written passed through the regular
stages of gradual depreciation, and it is more difficult
now to realise that we considered it at the time very
difficult. Probably, however, subsequent travellers
have improved considerably on the details of the route
we actually followed; at any rate the ascent is now
considered quite proper for a novice to attempt, at
any rate by the novice himself. We worked ourselves
slowly along in the teeth of a biting cold wind, and
without finding the fixed rope necessary to assist our
progress. Reaching the ridge again, the way became
distinctly easier, and we felt now that the peak was
at our mercy. Presently, however, we came to a huge
inverted pyramid of rock that tried rather successfully
to look like the summit, and we had some little difficulty
in surmounting it. By dint of strange acrobatic
<pb n='47'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>feats and considerable exertion we hoisted our leading
guide on to the top. It was fortunate for him perhaps
that the seams of his garments were not machine-sewn,
or he would certainly have rent his raiment. Finding,
however, that the only alternative that offered when
he got to the top of the rock was to get down again on
the other side, the rest of us concluded that on the
whole we should prefer to walk round. The last few
yards were perfectly easy, and at 1.30 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi> we stood on
the summit enjoying a most magnificent view in every
direction.
</p>

<note place="margin">Effects of reaching a summit</note>

<p>
It is a somewhat curious phenomenon, but one
frequently remarked, that the mountaineer’s characteristics
seem abruptly to change when he reaches
the summit of a peak. The impressionable, excitable
person instantly becomes preternaturally calm and
prosaic, while those of lymphatic temperament have
not unfrequently been observed to develop suddenly
rather explosive qualities, and to yell or wave their
hats without any very apparent incitement thereto.
Individuals whose detractors hold to be gifted with
poetic attributes have been heard to utter quite
commonplace remarks, and I have even known a
phlegmatic companion so far forget himself, under
these modifying circumstances, as to make an excessively
bad pun and laugh very heartily at it himself,
quite an unusual occurrence in a wag. Others find
relief for their feelings by punching their companions
<pb n='48'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>violently in the back, or resorting to such horse-play
as the area of the summit allows scope for. Directly,
however, the descent commences the climber resumes
his normal nature. The fact is, that in most cases,
perhaps, the chief pleasure of the expedition does not
come at the moment when the climber realises that he
is about to undo, as it were, all his work of the day.
There is no real climax of an expedition, and, as has
been said, it is quite artificial to suppose that the
enjoyment must culminate on reaching the top. But
still it is considered proper to testify to some unusual
emotional feelings. Some of the most enjoyable climbs
that the mountaineer can recall in after life, are not
those in which he has reached any particular point.
Guides consider it becoming to evince in a somewhat
forced way the liveliness of their delight on completing
an ascent. But such joy as they exhibit is usually
about as genuine and heartfelt as an organ-grinder’s
grin, or a Lord Mayor’s smile on receiving a guest
whom he does not know and who has merely come to
feed at his expense.
</p>

<p>
The wind was too cold to permit of a very long
stay on the summit, and having added a proper
number of stones to the cairn, a ceremony as indispensable
as the cutting of a notch in the mainmast
when the traditional fisherman changes his shirt, we
descended rapidly to the point where it was necessary
to quit the ridge. Down the first portion of the steep
<pb n='49'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>rock slope we passed with great caution, some of the
blocks of stone being treacherously loose, or only
lightly frozen to the face.
</p>

<note place="margin">A narrow escape</note>

<p>
We had arrived at the most difficult part of the
whole climb, and at a rock passage which at that
time we considered was the nastiest we had ever
encountered. The smooth, almost unbroken face of
the slope scarcely afforded any foot-hold, and our
security almost entirely depended on the rope we had
laid down in our ascent. Had not the rope been in
position we should have varied our route, and no
doubt found a line of descent over this part much
easier than the one we actually made for, even without
any help from the fixed cord. Imseng was far
below, working his way back to the arête, while the
rest of the party were holding on or moving but
slowly with faces turned to the mountain. Suddenly
I heard a shout from above; those below glanced up
at once: a large flat slab of rock, that had afforded
us good hold in ascending, but proved now to have
been only frozen in to a shallow basin of ice, had been
dislodged by the slightest touch from one of the party
above, and was sliding down straight at us. It seemed
an age, though the stone could not have had to
fall more than ten feet or so, before it reached us.
Just above me it turned its course slightly; Franz,
who was just below, more in its direct line of descent,
attempted to stop the mass, but it ground his hands
<pb n='50'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>against the rock and swept by straight at Imseng. A
yell from us hardly awoke him to the danger: the
slab slid on faster and faster, but just as we expected
to see our guide swept away, the rock gave a bound
for the first time, and as, with a startled expression,
he flung himself against the rock face, it leapt
up and, flying by within a few inches of his head,
thundered down below. A moment or two of silence
followed, and then a modified cheer from Imseng, as
subdued as that of a <q>super</q> welcoming a theatrical
king, announced his safety, and he looked up at us
with a serious expression on his face. Franz’s escape
had been a remarkably lucky one, but his hands were
badly cut about and bruised. In fact it was a near
thing for all of us, and the mere recollection will
still call up that odd sort of thrill a man experiences
on suddenly recollecting at 11 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi> that he ought to
have dined out that evening with some very particular
people. Had not the rock turned its course just
before it reached Franz, and bounded from the face
of the mountain over Imseng’s head, one or more
of the party must unquestionably have been swept
away. The place was rather an exceptional one,
and the rock glided a remarkably long distance without
a bound, but still the incident may serve to
show that falling stones are not a wholly imaginary
danger.
</p>

<note place="margin">The youthful tourist</note>

<p>
It would have been difficult, with the elementary
<pb n='51'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>knowledge of mountaineering that I now see we
possessed at that day, to have descended without
using the attached rope, and quite out of the question
for anyone possessed of a proper respect for his suit
of dittos to have done so. In this latter respect we
had to exercise economical caution: for we had no
very great store at the hotel or many changes of
raiment. It is generally possible to gauge pretty
accurately an Alpine traveller’s experience by the
amount of luggage he takes on a tour. Some tourists,
following the advice given in the <q>Practical Guide
Book</q> (a disconnected work written in the style of
Mr. Jingle’s conversation, but much in favour at one
time), were in the habit of travelling with one suit of
clothes and a portable bath. The latter, though they
took it with them, they seldom took more than once;
at the best it was of comparatively little use as an
article of apparel, but imparted an aromatic flavour
to anything packed up in its immediate neighbourhood.
In those youthful days we considered, forsooth,
that a little leathern wallet adequately replaced a
portmanteau, and in transporting luggage did not
always act on the sound commercial maxim that you
should never do anything for yourself which a paid
person might do equally well for you; consequently a
heavy rain shower reduced the traveller to inactivity,
and an oversight on the part of the laundress entailed
consequences that it is not permissible to mention.
</p>

<pb n='52'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>

<p>
Meanwhile our turn had come to move on. A
zigzagging crack, which was too narrow to admit of
anything but a most uncomfortable position, afforded
the only hand and foot hold on which we could rely.
Our gloveless hands, clutching at the rope, cooled
down slowly to an unpleasant temperature that rendered
it doubtful whether they were attached to the
arms or not, and we began to wish we had gone down
the Zinal side of the mountain. However, Imseng
wormed himself along the rocks, to which he adhered
with the tenacity of a lizard, and finally reached the
end of our rope and a region of comparative safety.
We followed his example slowly, and, having joined
him, seated ourselves on some rocks inappropriately
designed for repose, and finished off the food we had
with us. Climbing carefully down the east face of
the mountain, we reached the snow ridge and passed
rapidly along it, our spirits rising exuberantly as we
looked back on the vanquished peak. As usually
happens, the guides had entirely forgotten the place
where they had concealed our baggage on the ascent,
and in fact had hidden it so carefully that they had
some difficulty in finding it when they came to the spot.
It is curious to note how often the instinct of guides,
so much talked about, is at fault in this matter, and
how systematically they are in the habit of carrying
up on the mountains superfluous articles, hiding
<pb n='53'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>them with entirely unnecessary precautions, and subsequently
forgetting the whole transaction.
</p>

<note place="margin">Hotel trials</note>

<p>
While they searched about for their cache we
enjoyed the use of tobacco, if such an expression be
allowable in the case of some curious stuff purchased
in the valley. Still, as the packet in which it was
contained was labelled <q>Tabak,</q> we considered it to be
such. Being indulgently disposed, and not being
profound botanists, poetic license alone enabled us to
imagine that

</lg>

<note place="margin">The gushers</note>

<p>
It may have been so; it gave me a sore throat.
Descending rapidly, we reached the Monte Rosa Hotel
at 7 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi>, in an exultant frame of mind, a ragged condition
of attire, and a preposterous state of hunger.
The whole time occupied in the climb was sixteen
hours. Of this an hour was wasted while we were
waiting for the telescope, and three-quarters of an
hour was spent in arranging the rope, by the aid of
which we descended. Probably in actual climbing
and walking we employed rather under thirteen
hours; but the snow was in excellent order, and we
descended on the whole very rapidly. Our trials were
not over for the day, when we reached the hotel. Two
arch young things had prepared an ambuscade and
<pb n='54'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>surprised us successfully at the door of the hotel.
Sweetly did they gush. <q>Oh! where had we been?</q>
We said we had been up in the mountains, indicating
the general line of locality with retrospective thumb.
<q>Oh! wasn’t it fearfully dangerous? Weren’t we all
tied tightly together?</q> (as if, on the principle of
union being strength, we had been fastened up and
bound like a bundle of quill pens). <q>Oh! hadn’t we
done something very wonderful?</q> The situation was
becoming irritating. <q>Oh! didn’t we have to drag
ourselves up precipices by the chamois horns on the
tops of our sticks?</q> <q>No indeed——</q> <q>Oh! really,
now, that guide there</q> (a driver with imperfectly buttoned
garments who was sitting on the wall with a
vacuous look) <q>told us you were <hi rend='italic'>such</hi> wonderful
climbers.</q> It was becoming exasperating. <q>And oh!
we wanted to ask you so much, for you know all about
it. <hi rend='italic'>Do</hi> you think we could walk over the Théodule?
Papa</q> (great heavens! he must be a nonagenarian)
<q>thinks we should be so foolish to try. Could you
persuade him?</q> <q>Well, really——</q> <q>Wouldn’t the
precipices make us dreadfully giddy?</q> <q>No, no more
than you are now.</q> <q>Oh! thank you so much. And
you really won’t tell us what awful ascent you have
been making?</q> It was maddening. <q>After dinner
perhaps?</q> <q>Oh! thank you. Oh! Sustie</q> (this to
each other; they both spoke together: probably the
names were Susie and Tottie), <q>won’t that be
delight<pb n='55'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>ful?</q> By dexterous manœuvring we escaped these
gushing Circes during the evening. Happening to
pass later on by the open door of the little <hi rend='italic'>salon</hi>, the
following remark was overheard: <q>My dear, the conceit
of these climbing objects is quite dreadful. They
do nothing but flourish their nasty sticks and ropes
about: they want the whole place to themselves</q> (we
had been sitting on wooden chairs in the middle of
the high street, near an unsavoury heap of refuse),
<q>and they talk, talk, talk, my dear, all day and all
night about what they have been doing in the mountains
and of their nonsensical climbs. And what
frights they look. I think they are perfectly horrid.</q>

<note place="margin">The last peaks to
surrender</note>

<p>
Accounts of failures on the mountains in books of
Alpine adventure are as much out of place, according
to some critics, as a new hat in a crowded church.
Humanly speaking, the possession of this head-gear
under such circumstances renders it impossible to
divert the thoughts wholly from worldly affairs. This,
however, by the way. Now the pioneers of the Alps,
the Stephenses, the Willses, the Moores, the Morsheads,
and many others, had used up all new
material with alarming rapidity, I might say voracity,
<pb n='57'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>before the climbing epoch to which the present
sketches relate. There is an old story of a man who
arrived running in a breathless condition on a railway
platform just in time to see the train disappearing.
<q>You didn’t run fast enough, sir,</q> remarked the porter
to him. <q>You idiot!</q> was the answer, <q>I ran plenty
fast enough, but I didn’t begin running soon enough.</q>
Even so was it with the climbers of our generation.
They climbed with all possible diligence, but they began
their climbing too late. Novelty, that is the desire
for achieving new expeditions, was still considered of
paramount importance, but unfortunately there was
very little new material left. It is difficult to realise
adequately now the real veneration entertained for an
untrodden peak. A certain amount of familiarity
seemed indispensable before a new ascent was even
seriously contemplated. It had occurred to certain
bold minds that the aiguilles around Chamouni
might not be quite as bad as they looked. In 1873
the chief of the still unconquered peaks of the Mont
Blanc district were the Aiguille des Charmoz, the
Aiguille Blaitière, the Aiguille du Géant, the Aiguille
Peuteret, the Aiguille du Dru, and a few other minor
points. All of these have since been captured, some
of them bound in chains. Opinions differed considerably
as to their accessibility. Some hopeful spirits
thought that by constantly <q>pegging away</q> they
might be scaled; others thought that the only feasible
<pb n='58'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>plan would be indeed to peg away, but were of opinion
that the pegs should be of iron and driven into the
rock. Such views naturally lead to discussions, sometimes
rather heated, as to whether mountaineering
morality might fitly tolerate such aids to the climber.
Of all the peaks mentioned above, the Aiguille du Dru
and the Aiguille du Géant were considered as the
most hopeful by the leading guides, though the older
members of that body held out little prospect of
success. It is a rather curious fact that the majority
of the leading guides who gave their opinions to us in
the matter thought that the Aiguille du Géant was
the more promising peak to attack. Subsequent experience
has proved that they were greatly in error in
this judgment. The Aiguille du Géant has indeed
been ascended, but much more aid than is comprised
in the ordinary mountaineer’s equipment was found
necessary. In fact, the stronghold was not carried
by direct assault, but by sapping and mining. There
is a certain rock needle in Norway which, I am told,
was once, and once only, ascended by a party on surveying
operations bent. No other means could be
found, so a wooden structure was built up around the
peak, such as may be seen investing a dilapidated
church steeple; and the mountain, like the Royal
Martyr of history, yielded up its crowning point at
the scaffold. We did not like the prospect of employing
any such architectural means to gain our end and
<pb n='59'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>the summit, and, from no very clearly defined reasons,
turned our attention chiefly to the Aiguille du Dru.
Perhaps the prominent appearance of this Aiguille,
and the fact that its outline was so familiar from
the Montanvert, gradually imbued us with a certain
sense of familiarity, which ultimately developed
into a notion that if not actually accessible it might
at least be worth trying. It seemed too prominent to
be impossible; from its height—12,517 feet only—the
mountain would doubtless not attract much attention,
were it not so advantageously placed. Thousands
of tourists had gazed on its symmetrical form: it had
been photographed, stared at through binoculars,
portrayed in little distorted pictures on useless work-boxes,
trays and other toy-shop gimcracks, more
often than any other mountain of the chain, Mont
Blanc excepted. Like an undersized volunteer officer,
it no doubt made the most of its height. But in truth
the Aiguille du Dru is a magnificent mountain form,
with its vast dark precipices on the north face, with
its long lines of cliff, broken and jagged and sparsely
wrinkled with gullies free from even a patch or trace
of snow. Point after point, and pinnacle after pinnacle
catch the gaze as we follow the edge of the
north-west <q>Kamm,</q> until the eye rests at last on the
singularly graceful isosceles triangle of rock which
forms the peak. It is spoken of lightly as merely
a tooth of rock jutting up from the ridge which
<pb n='60'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>culminates in the Aiguille Verte, but when viewed from
the Glacier de la Charpoua it is obviously a separate
mountain; at any rate it became such when the highest
point of the ridge, the Aiguille Verte, had been climbed
by somebody else. The cleft in the ridge on the right
side of the main mass of the Aiguille du Dru is a
very deep one as seen from the glacier, and the sharp
needle of rock which is next in the chain is a long
way from the Aiguille du Dru itself. North and south
the precipices run sheer down to the glaciers beneath.
The mountain has then four distinct sides, three of
them running down to great depths. Thus, even in
the prehistoric days of Alpine climbing, it had some
claim to individuality and might fairly be considered
as something more than, as it were, one unimportant
pinnacle on the roof of some huge cathedral. Perhaps,
however, repeated failures to ascend the mountain
begot undue veneration and caused an aspiring climber
to look with a prejudiced eye on its dimensions.
</p>

<note place="margin">The Aiguille du Dru</note>

<p>
So far as I know, the mountain had never been
assailed till 1873, when Messrs. Pendlebury and
Kennedy made an attempt. Mr. R. Pendlebury has
kindly furnished me with notes of the climb, which I
may be allowed to reproduce nearly in his own words:—Two
parties started simultaneously for the expedition.
One was composed of Messrs. Kennedy and Marshall,
with the guides Johann Fischer and Ulric Almer of
Grindelwald; the other party consisted of the Rev.
<pb n='61'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>C. Taylor, Messrs. W. M. and R. Pendlebury, with the
guides Hans Baumann, Peter Baumann, and Edouard
Cupelin. The first-mentioned party slept at the
Montanvert, while the others enjoyed themselves in a
bivouac high up on the side of the Glacier de la Charpoua
between the Aiguille du Dru and the Aiguille
Moine. This Glacier de la Charpoua, it may be mentioned,
is sometimes called the Glacier du Chapeau.
</p>

<note place="margin">The first attempt</note>

<p>
The bivouac appears to have been so comfortable
that Mr. Pendlebury and his friends did not take
advantage of their start. The Montanvert detachment,
who found no such inducement to stay one moment
longer than was absolutely necessary<note place="foot">In the old house, be it noted—not the modern luxurious combination
of a granite fortress and a palace.</note> in their costly
quarters, caught them up the next morning, and the
whole party started together. Mr. Kennedy’s guides
kept to the left of the Glacier de la Charpoua, which
looks more broken up than the right-hand side, but
apparently proved better going. This, however, it
should be observed, was in 1873, and these hanging
glaciers alter marvellously in detail from year to year,
though always preserving from a distance the same
general features. On the same principle, at the
proper distance, a mother may be mistaken for her
daughter, especially by a judicious person. But on
drawing near, however discreet the observer may be,
he is yet conscious of little furrows, diminutive
<pb n='62'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>wrinkles, and perhaps of a general shrinkage not to
be found in the more recent specimen. Speaking very
generally, I should say that these glaciers are, on the
whole, easier to traverse than they used to be: at any
rate my own personal observation of this particular
little glacier extends over a period of some years, and
the intricacies—it is hardly proper to call them difficulties—were
distinctly less towards the end of the time
than they were at the beginning. Of course a different
interpretation might be put upon such an opinion:
with the evolution of mountaineering skill the complexity
of these crumpled up snow-fields may seem to
have disentangled, but I am assured that in this particular
case it was not so.
</p>

<note place="margin">First attempt on the peak</note>

<p>
This digression must be pardoned. It arose
naturally from the circumstance that the route Mr.
Kennedy adopted would have proved, at any rate in
later years, a digression from the best way. Mr.
Pendlebury’s party went straight up, keeping, that is,
to the right-hand side of the glacier. Towards the
upper part the snow slopes became steeper, and soon
some step-cutting was required. The object in view
was to reach the lowest point in the ridge between the
Aiguille du Dru and the Aiguille Verte. It was
thought that, by turning to the left from the col,
it might be possible to reach the summit by the
eastern arête. The col itself from below seemed
easily attainable by means of a narrow zigzagging
<pb n='63'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>gully, interrupted here and there, that runs down
from the summit of the ridge. Ascending by the
rocks on the left of the gully the party made for
some little way good progress, but then a sudden
change came over the scene. After a consultation, it
was proposed that the guides Hans Baumann, Peter
Baumann, and Fischer should go on a little by themselves
and make for the ridge, which they estimated
lay about half an hour above them. They were then
to examine the rocks above and to bring back a report.
The rest of the party remained where they were, and
disported themselves as comfortably as circumstances
would permit. Hour after hour, however, passed
away, and the three guides seemed to make but little
progress. They returned at last with the melancholy
tidings that they had climbed nearly up to the ridge
and had found the rocks very difficult and dangerous.
(It should be noted that the line of attack chosen on
this occasion—the first serious attempt on the peak—was
devised by Hans Baumann, and it says much for
his sagacity that this very route proved years afterwards
to be the right one.) Questioned as to the
advisability of proceeding upwards, the guides employed
their favourite figure of speech and remarked
that not for millions of francs would they consent
to try again. Hans Baumann asserted that he had
never climbed more difficult rocks. This opinion, as
Mr. Pendlebury suggested at the time, was probably
<pb n='64'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>owing to the fact that the cliffs above were covered
with snow and glazed with ice, and this condition of
the mountain face made each step precarious. The
amateurs of the party were of opinion that the ridge
would prove attainable later in the season or in exceptionally
fine weather. As to the possibility of climbing
the rocks above—that is to say, the actual peak—none
of the party were able to come to any very positive
conclusion. At a rough guess it was estimated that
the party halted between two and three hundred feet
below the ridge. On the presentation of the guides
report the whole caravan turned back and reached
Chamouni safely, but not entirely without incident, for
the monotony of the descent and Mr. Taylor’s head
were broken by the fall of a big stone. This little
accident, Mr. Pendlebury remarked with disinterested
cheerfulness, was but a trifle. I have not been able
to ascertain Mr. Taylor’s views on the subject.
</p>

<p>
When our party first essayed the ascent we knew
none of the above particulars, save only that some
mountaineers had endeavoured to reach the ridge
but had failed to ascend to any great height. Of the
actual cause of their ill success, and whether it were
owing to the unpropitious elements or to the actual
difficulties encountered, we were unaware.
</p>

<note place="margin">Huts and sleeping out</note>

<p>
At the time of which I am writing, a somewhat
novel mode of ascending mountains was coming into
vogue, which consisted in waiting for a suitable day at
<pb n='65'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>headquarters, starting at unheard-of hours, and completing
the expedition in one day—that is, within
twenty-four hours. It was argued in support of this
plan, that it was economical and that bivouacking
was but a laborious and expensive method of obtaining
discomfort. There are, said the advocates of the
method, but few mountains in the Alps which cannot
be ascended with much greater comfort in one day
than in two. The day’s climb is much more enjoyable
when it is possible to start from sleeping quarters in
which it is possible to sleep. The argument that repose
in hotel beds, though undoubtedly more luxurious,
was of comparatively little use if there were no time
to enjoy it, was held to be little to the purpose. Some
enthusiasts were wont to state that passing a night in a
chalet, or those magnified sentry boxes called cabanes,
constituted half the enjoyment on the expedition. This
is a little strong—like the flavour of the cabanes—and
if it were actually so the whole pleasure would be
but small. The camper out arises in the morning
from his delicious couch of soft new-mown hay in
a spotty and sticky condition, attended with considerable
local irritation, and feeling like a person who has
recently had his hair cut, with a pinafore but loosely
tied around his neck. Porters, like barbers, exhibit a
propensity for indulging in garlic immediately before
pursuing their avocation, which is not without discomfort
to their employers. (And here I may note as a
<pb n='66'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>psychological fact that one action of this permeating
vegetable is to induce confidential propensities in the
consumer. The point may be deemed worthy of investigation,
by personal experiment, by botanists and
students of materia medica, men who in the interests
of science are not prone to consider their personal
comfort and finer sensibilities.) Again, in unsettled
weather a fine day is often wasted by journeying up in
the afternoon to some chalet, or hovel, merely to enjoy
the pleasure of returning the following morning in the
rain. There is some force too in the argument that
but little actual time is gained by the first day’s performance,
for it is very difficult to start at anything
like the prearranged hour for departure from a camp.
An immensity of time is always spent in lighting the
morning fire, preparing breakfast, and getting under
way. On the other side, some little time is undoubtedly
saved by discarding the wholly superfluous
ceremony of washing, a process at once suggesting
itself to the mind of the Briton abroad if he beholds a
basin and cold water.
</p>

<p>
The sum of the argument would seem to be that
camping out in some one else’s hut is but an unpleasant
fiction; that if the climber chooses to go to the expense,
he can succeed in making himself a trifle less
comfortable in his own tent or under a rock than he
would be in an hotel; and that he is the wisest man who
refrains from bivouacking when it is not really
neces<pb n='67'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>sary and is able to make the best of matters when it
is: and undoubtedly for many of the recognised
expeditions it is essential to have every possible
minute of spare time in hand.
</p>

<note place="margin">The Chamouni guide system</note>

<p>
We were naturally rather doubtful as to the successful
issue of our expedition, at any rate at the first
attempt, and we therefore impressed upon the guides
the necessity of not divulging the plan. The secret,
however, proved to be so big that it was too much for
two, and they imparted consequently so much of the
information as they had not adequate storage for in
their own minds to any who chose to listen. Consequently
our intentions were thoroughly well known
before we started. There were in those days, perhaps,
more good guides, at any rate there were fewer bad
ones, in Chamouni than are to be found nowadays.
We could not, however, obtain the services—even if
we had desired them—of any of the local celebrities.
As a matter of fact, we were both of opinion that a
training in climbing, such as is acquired among the
Oberland and Valais men by chamois hunting and
constant rock work, would be most likely to have
produced the qualities which would undoubtedly be
needed on the aiguilles.
</p>

<p>
The question of the efficiency of the Chamouni
guides and of the Chamouni guide system, a question
coeval with mountaineering itself, was burning then
as fiercely as it does now. The Alpine Club had
<pb n='68'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>striven in vain to improve matters; they had pointed
out that ability to answer a kind of mountaineering
catechism did not in itself constitute a very reliable
test of a peasant’s power; they had pointed out too
that the plan of electing a <q>guide chef</q> from the general
body of guides was one most open to abuse, one
sure to lead to favouritism and injustice, and one
obviously ill calculated to bring to the front any
specially efficient man. But unhappily the regulations
of the body of guides were, and still are, entangled
hopelessly in the French equivalent for red
tape. Jealousy and mistrust of the German-speaking
guides, whom serious mountaineers were beginning to
import in rather formidable numbers, were beginning
to awaken in the simple bosoms of the Savoyard peasants;
and our proceedings were consequently looked
upon with contemptuous disfavour by those who had
any knowledge of our project.
</p>

<note place="margin">A word on guides</note>

<p>
On August 18, 1873, we started. Our guides were
Alexander Burgener as leader, Franz Andermatten,
the best of companions, our guide, our friend, and
sometimes our philosopher, as second string, while a
taciturn porter of large frame and small mind, who
came from the Saas valley, completed the tale. Of
Burgener’s exceptional talent in climbing difficult
rocks we had had already good proof, and no doubt
he was, and still is, a man of remarkable daring,
endurance, and activity on rocks. I had reached
<pb n='69'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>then that stage in the mountaineering art at which a
man is prone to consider the guide he knows best as,
beyond all comparison, the best guide that could
possibly exist. The lapse of years renders me perhaps
better able now to form a dispassionate judgment
of Burgener’s capacity and skill. Both were very great.
I have seen at their work most of the leaders in this
department. Burgener never had the marvellous
neatness and finish so characteristic of Melchior
Anderegg, who, when mountaineering has passed
away into the limbo of extinct sports, such as bear-baiting,
croquet, and pell-mell, will, if he gets his
deserts, even by those who remember Maguignaz,
Carrel, Croz, and Almer, still be spoken of as <hi rend='italic'>the</hi> best
guide that ever lived. Nor was Burgener gifted with
the same simple unaffected qualities which made
Jakob Anderegg’s loss so keenly felt, nor the lightness
and agility of Rey or Jaun; but he united well in
himself qualities of strength, carefulness, perseverance
and activity, and possessed in addition the numerous
attributes of observation, experience, and desire for
improvement in his art which together make up what
is spoken of as the natural instinct of guides. These
were the qualities that made him a first-rate, indeed
an exceptional, guide. <hi rend='italic'>Nunc liberavi animam meam.</hi>
There is an old saying, involving a sound doctrine,
that
</p>
<lg>
<l>When you flatter lay it on thick;</l>
<l>Some will come off, but a deal will stick.</l>
</lg>
    <p><pb n='70'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>The porter proved himself a skilful and strong climber,
but he was as silent as an oyster and, like that bivalve
mollusc when the freshness of its youth has passed
off, was perpetually on the gape.
</p>
<note place="margin">A landlord’s peculiarities</note>
<p>
A hot walk—it always is hot along this part—took
us up to the Montanvert. The moonlight threw quaint,
fantastic shadows along the path and made the dewy
gossamer filaments which swung from branch to
branch across the track twinkle into grey and silver;
and anything more aggravating than these spiders’
threads at night it is hard to imagine. What earthly
purpose these animals think they serve by this reckless
nocturnal expenditure of bodily glue it is hard to say:
possibly the lines are swung across in order that they
may practise equilibrium; possibly the threads may
serve as lines of escape and retreat after the male
spinners have been a-wooing. The atmosphere
through the wood was as stuffy as a ship’s saloon in
a storm, and we were right glad to reach the Montanvert
at 3.30 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> Here, being athirst, we clamoured
for refreshment. The landlord of the ramshackle
hostelry at once appeared in full costume; indeed I
observed that during the summer it was impossible to
tell from his attire whether he had arisen immediately
from bed or no. He seemed to act on the principle
of the Norwegian peasant, who apparently undresses
once a year when the winter commences, and resumes
his garments when the light once more comes back
<pb n='71'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>and the summer season sets in. Our friend had
cultivated to great perfection the art of half sleeping
during his waking hours—that is, during such time
as he might be called upon to provide entertainment
for man and beast. Now at the Montanvert, during
the tourists’ season, this period extended over the whole
twenty-four hours. It was necessary, therefore, in
order that he might enjoy a proper physiological period
of rest, for him to remain in a dozing state—a sort
of æstival hybernation—for the whole time, which in
fact he did; or else he was by nature a very dull person,
and had actually a very restricted stock of ideas.
</p>

<p>
The landlord produced at once a battered teapot
with a little sieve dangling from its snout, which had
been stewing on the hob, and poured out the contained
fluid into two stalked saucers of inconvenient diameter.
Stimulated by this watery extract, we entered into
conversation together. The sight of a tourist with
an ice axe led by a kind of reflex process to the landlord’s
unburdening his mind with his usual remarks.
Like other natives of the valley he had but two ideas
of <q>extraordinary</q> expeditions. <q>Monsieur is going
to the Jardin?</q> he remarked. <q>No, monsieur isn’t.</q>
<q>Then beyond a doubt monsieur will cross the Col du
Géant?</q> he said, playing his trump card. <q>No,
monsieur will not.</q> <q>Pardon—where does monsieur
expect to go to?</q> <q>On the present occasion we go to
try the Aiguille du Dru.</q> The landlord smiled in an
<pb n='72'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>aggravating manner. <q>Does monsieur think he will
get up?</q> <q>Time will show.</q> <q>Ah!</q> The landlord,
who had a chronic cold in the head, searched for
his pockethandkerchief, but not finding it, modified
the necessary sniff into one of derision, and then
demanded the usual exorbitant price for the refreshment,
amounting to about five times the value of
the teapot, sieve and all. We paid, and left him
chuckling softly to himself at our insane idea, as he
replaced the teapot on the hob in readiness for the
next arrival. That landlord, though physically sleepy,
was still wide awake in matters of finance. He once
charged me five francs for the loan of a secondhand
collection of holes which he termed a blanket.
</p>

<note place="margin">We see a chamois</note>

<p>
We got on to the glacier at the usual point and made
straight across the slippery hummocks to the grass
slope encircling the base of the Aiguille du Dru and
the Glacier de la Charpoua. The glacier above gives
birth to a feeble meandering little stream which
wanders fitfully down the mountain side. At first we
kept to the left, but after a while crossed the little
torrent, and bearing more to the right plodded
leisurely up the steep grass and rock slope. We had
made good progress when of a sudden Franz gave a
loud whistle and then fell flat down. The other two
guides immediately followed his example and beckoned
to us with excited gesticulations to behave in a
similarly foolish manner. Thereupon we too sat down,
<pb n='73'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>and enquired what the purport of this performance
might be. It turned out that there was a very little
chamois about half a mile off. Knowing that it would
be impossible to induce the guides to move on till the
animal had disappeared, we seized the opportunity of
taking an early breakfast. The guides meanwhile
wriggled about on their stomachs, with eyes starting
out of their heads, possessed by an extraordinary
desire to miss no single movement of the object of
their attention. <q>See, it moves,</q> said Franz in a
whisper. <q>Himmel! it is feeding,</q> said Burgener.
<q>It must be the same that Johann saw three weeks
ago.</q> <q>Ach! no, that was but a little one</q> (no true
chamois hunter will ever allow that a brother sportsman
can possibly have set eyes on a larger animal
than himself). <q>Truly it is fine.</q> <q>Thunder weather!
it moves its head.</q> In their excitement I regretted
that I could not share, not being well versed in
hunting craft: my own experience of sport in the Alps
being limited to missing one marmot that was sitting
on a rock licking its paws. In due course the chamois
walked away. Apparently much relieved by there being
no further necessity to continue in their former uncomfortable
attitudes, the guides sat up and fell to a
warm discussion as to the size of the animal. A
chamois is to a guide as a fish to the baffled angler
or the last new baby to a monthly nurse, and is
always pronounced to be beyond question the finest
<pb n='74'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>that has ever been seen. To this they agreed generally,
but Franz, whose spirits had suddenly evaporated,
now shook his head dismally, with the remark
that it was unlucky to see a single chamois, and that we
should have no success that day. Undaunted by his
croaking, we pursued our way to the right side of the
glacier, while our guide, who had a ballad appropriate
to every occasion, sang rather gaspingly a tremulous
little funeral dirge. We worked well across to the
right, in order to obtain the best possible view of the
Aiguille, and halted repeatedly while discussing the
best point at which to attack the rocks. While thus
engaged in reconnoitring close under the cliffs of the
ridge running between the Aiguille Moine and the
Aiguille Verte, a considerable block of ice, falling from
the rocks above, whizzed past just in front of us and
capered gaily down the slope. Hereupon we came
rather rapidly to the conclusion that we had better
proceed. Half an hour further on we reached the
top of a steep little snow slope, and a point secure
from falling stones and ice. Recognising that we must
soon cross back to the rocks of the Dru, we tried to
come to a final conclusion as to the way to be chosen.
As usual, everybody pointed out different routes:
even a vestry meeting could hardly have been less
unanimous. Some one now ventured to put a question
that had been troubling in reality our minds for some
time past, viz. which of the peaks that towered above
<pb n='75'/><anchor id='Pg075'/>us was really the Aiguille du Dru. On the left there
were two distinct points which, though close together,
were separated apparently by a deep rift, and some
distance to the right of the col which the previous
party had tried to reach, a sharp tooth of rock towered
up to a considerable height. Evidently, however,
from its position this latter needle could not be
visible from Chamouni or from the Montanvert.
Again, it was clear that the mass comprising the two
points close together must be visible from the valley,
but which of the two was the higher? Alexander
gave as his opinion that the more distant of these
two points, that on the right, was the higher, and
turned to the porter for confirmation. That worthy
nodded his head affirmatively with extreme sagacity,
evidently implying that he was of the same opinion.
Franz on the other hand thought the left-hand peak
was the one that we ought to make for, arguing that
it most resembled the Dru as seen from the Montanvert,
that there was probably little difference in height
between the two, that our ascent would not be believed
in unless we were to place a flag on the point visible
from Chamouni, and finally that the left-hand peak
seemed to be the easier, and would probably be found
to conceal the sharper point of the right-hand summit.
Having expressed these views, he in turn looked
towards the porter to ascertain his sentiments. The
porter, who was evidently of a complaisant
tempera<pb n='76'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>ment, nodded his head very vigorously to intimate
that these arguments seemed the more powerful of
the two to his mind, and then cocked his head on
one side in a knowing manner, intended to express
that he was studying the angles and that he was
prepared to find himself in the right whichever view
prevailed. We did not find out for certain till some
time after that the right-hand summit, though concealed
from view by the Montanvert, is very distinctly
visible from Chamouni: excusable ignorance, as most
of the Chamouni people are unaware of it to this day.
Professor Forbes, as Mr. Douglas Freshfield has kindly
pointed out to me, with his usual accuracy distinguished
and also measured the two summits, giving
their heights respectively as 12,178, and 12,245 feet.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Travels in the Alps</hi>, p. 119.</note>
Knowing little as we did then of the details of the
mountain, we followed Franz’s advice and made for
the left-hand peak, under the impression that if one
proved accessible the other might also, and there really
seemed no reason why we should not, if occasion
demanded, ascend both.
</p>

<note place="margin">Doubts as to the peak</note>

<p>
Leading up from the glacier two distinct lines of
attack presented themselves. The right-hand ridge
descends to the col very precipitously, but still we had
some idea that the rocks did not look wholly impossible.
Again, on the left of the Dru the rocks are cut
away very abruptly and form the long precipitous
<pb n='77'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>ridge seen from the Montanvert. This ridge was so
jagged that we could see no possible advantage in
climbing to any part of it, except just at the termination
where it merges into the south-western face of the
main mountain. The choice therefore, in our judgment,
lay between storming the mountain by the face
right opposite to us or else making for the col and the
right-hand ridge; but the latter was the route that
Messrs. Pendlebury and Kennedy had followed, and we
could not hope to succeed where such giants had failed.
Burgener indeed wished to try, but the rest of the
party were unanimously in favour of attempting to
find a way up the face, a route that at the worst had
the merit of novelty. We thought too that if a
closer acquaintance proved that the crags were ill
arranged for upward locomotion, we might be able to
work round on the face and so reach the col by a
more circuitous route. With the naked eye—especially
a myopic one—the rocks appeared unpromising
enough; while viewed through the telescope the rocks
looked utterly impossible. But little faith, however, can
be rested in telescopic observations of a mountain, so
far as the question of determining a route is concerned.
Amateurs, who, as a rule, understand the use of a telescope
much better than guides, have not the requisite
experience to determine the value of what they see,
while but few guides see enough to form any basis for
determination. Moreover, the instrument we carried
<pb n='78'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>with us, though it had an extraordinary number of
sections and pulled out like the ill-fated tradesman’s
trousers in a pantomime, was not a very remarkable
one in the matter of definition. Still it is always proper
and orthodox to look at a new peak through the telescope,
and we were determined not to neglect any
formality on the present occasion.
</p>

<note place="margin">Telescopic observations</note>

<p>
We were now rather more than half-way up the
Glacier de la Charpoua. To reach the most promising-looking
point at which we might hope to get on the
rocks, it was necessary to travel straight across the
snow at about the level on which we stood. Now,
this Glacier de la Charpoua is not constructed on
ordinary principles. Instead of the orthodox transverse
bergschrund it possesses a longitudinal crack
running up its whole length, a peculiarity that vexed
us hugely. Half a dozen times did we attempt to cross
by some tempting-looking bridge, but on each occasion
we were brought to a stand by impassable crevasses;
then had to turn back, go up a little farther, and try
again. It was already late in the day and we could ill
spare the time lost in this to and fro movement.
Eventually we reached a little patch of rocks not far
from the head of the glacier. No sooner had we reached
these rocks than the guides hunted up a suitable place
and concealed some utterly worthless property as carefully
as if they expected evil-minded marauders to be
wandering about, seeking what they might pilfer.
<pb n='79'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>Having effected the cache with due care, Franz once
again burst into a strange carol, the burden of which
was unintelligible, but the chorus made frequent
allusion to <q>der Teufel.</q> We now saw that, after all,
the only feasible plan would be to cut our way still
higher up a steep slope, and thus to work right round,
describing a large curve. An occasional step required
to be scraped, for the glacier is in shadow till late in
the morning, owing to the Aiguille Verte intervening
and cutting off the sun’s rays. Throughout the day
our second guide had been burning with a desire to
exhibit the good qualities of the most portentous ice
axe I ever saw, an instrument of an unwieldy character
resembling a labourer’s pick on the top of a
May pole. Its dimensions were monstrous and its
weight preposterous: moreover, the cutting spike had
an evil curve and, instead of hewing out blocks of ice
neatly, preferred to ram a huge hole in the slope and
stick fast therein, while a quiver ran through its
mighty frame and communicated itself to the striker,
who shuddered at each blow as after taking a dose of
very bitter physic. However, Franz was so proud of
his halberd that we were obliged to sacrifice rapid
progress to the consideration of his feelings, and he
was accordingly sent on to cut the steps which were
now found necessary. With no little exertion did he
construct a staircase of which the steps were about the
size of foot baths, and with no slight impatience did
<pb n='80'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>we watch his gymnastics and athletic flourishes, which
were a sort of mixture of tossing the caber and throwing
the hammer combined with a touch of polo.
Ultimately we were able to quit the glacier for the
actual face of the mountain, at a point probably not
very much below that struck by the previous party;
but it was our intention at once to bear off to the left.
</p>

<note place="margin">Franz and his mighty axe</note>

<p>
We blundered a little on the rocks at first after
the long spell of snow-walking. A cry from Franz
caused us to look round, and we perceived that he
had got entangled with the big axe, the spike of which
was sticking into the third button of his waistcoat,
causing him, as the strain on the rope above and
below folded him up in a rather painful manner, to
assume the attitude of a mechanical toy monkey on a
stick. Fearing that he might be placed in the condition
in which cats’ meat is usually offered for sale, we
slackened the rope and saved him from impending
perforation, but with the result that the axe bounded
off down the slope, turned two or three summersaults,
and then stuck up defiantly in a distant patch of snow,
looking like a sign-post. While Franz went off to recover
his loved treasure we huddled together on a very
little ledge of rock, and sat there in a row like busts
on a shelf—if the simile be not considered anatomically
inappropriate. But these delays had wasted
much time, and already success seemed doubtful.
Little time could now be devoted to consultation, and
<pb n='81'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>little good would have come of it; now that we were
on the rocks the only thing to do was to go straight
on and see what would happen. At the same time we
had a dim consciousness that we were considerably to
the right of the best line of ascent. Our <q>general
idea</q>—to borrow a military phrase of which, by the
way, it may be remarked that the idea in question is
usually confined to the general and is not shared in
by the troops—consisted in making for the left-hand
side or Montanvert aspect of the final peak. We set
our teeth, whatever that may mean, then fell to with
a will and for some two hours went with scarcely a
check. And a rare two hours’ climb we had. The
very thought of it makes the pen travel swiftly over
the paper, as the scene comes back in every detail.
How Burgener led the way without hesitation and
almost without mistake; how our second guide chattered
unceasingly, caring nought for a listener; how
they both stuck to the rocks like limpets; how the big
axe got in everybody’s way; how the rope got caught
on every projecting spur of rock, jerking back the unwary,
or when loose sweeping down showers of small
angular stones from the little platforms and ridges,
thereby engendering ill blood and contumely; how
the silent porter climbed stolidly after us, and in the
plenitude of his taciturn good-humour poked at us
from below with his staff at inconvenient moments
and in sensitive places; how at one moment we were
<pb n='82'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>flat against the rock, all arms and legs, like crushed
spiders, and at another gathered into great loops like
a cheese maggot on the point of making a leap; how
a volley of little stones came whistling cheerily down
from above, playfully peppering us all round; how
our spirits rose with our bodies till we became as
excited as children: of all these things it boots not to
give any detailed description. Those who can recollect
similar occasions need but to be reminded of them,
and, to tell the truth, the minutiæ, though they are
so graven upon the mind that a clear impression could
be struck off years afterwards, are apt to prove somewhat
tedious. Two facts I may note. One, that the
rocks were at first very much easier than was expected;
another, that we should have done better had we discarded
the rope on this part of the climb: the rocks
were hardly a fit place for those who could not dispense
with its use. Ever and anon the guides’ spirits would
rise to that level which may be called the shouting
point, and they would jödel till they were black in the
face, while the melodious roll of sound echoed cheerily
back from the distant cliffs of the Aiguille Moine.
And so we journeyed up.
</p>

<note place="margin">A start in the wrong direction</note>

<p>
Meanwhile the weather had changed; black
clouds had come rolling up and were gathering
ominously above us; it was evident that we had no
chance of reaching the summit that day, even if it
were practicable, but still we persevered desperately
<pb n='83'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>in the hope of seeing some possible route for a future
attack. Progress, however, on a rock peak is necessarily
slow when there are five on the rope, and we
should probably have done more wisely if we had
divided into two parties. We kept well to the left to
a point on the face where a huge tower of rock stands
four-square to all the winds of heaven that blow; and
above us, as a matter of fact, there seemed to be a
good many winds. This landmark, very conspicuous
and characteristic of these aiguilles, seemed to be
close to the ridge, but on reaching it we found that
there was still a stiff passage intervening between us
and the point from which we could overlook the other
side of the mountain. Now we bore to the right and
the climbing became more difficult. We made our
way straight up a very shallow gully and finally
reached a point on the western ridge overlooking
the Montanvert, close to where this ridge merges into
the corresponding face of the peak. Here a halt was
called, for two reasons. In the first place a few flakes
of snow were softly falling around and the gathering
clouds betokened more to follow. Secondly, so far as
we could judge through the mist, it was apparently impossible
to ascend any higher from the place we had
reached. So we cast off the rope and clambered separately
to various points of vantage to survey the work
that lay before us. The summit of the peak, enveloped
in thin cloud, appeared to tower no great height above
<pb n='84'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>us, but we were too close under the cliff to estimate its
elevation very correctly. At the time we thought that
if we could only keep up the pace at which we had been
going, an hour’s climb would have sufficed to reach
the top. We found, it may be remarked parenthetically,
that we were egregiously in error in this
estimate some years later. The shifting clouds made
the rock face—that is, the small extent of it that we
could see at all—look much more difficult than in
all probability it actually was. Through the mists we
made out, indistinctly, a formidable-looking irregular
crack in the rock face running very straight up and
rather to our left, which apparently constituted the
only possible route from our position to a higher level.
But from where we stood we could not have reached
the lower end of this crack without a ladder of about
fifty feet in length, and the mist entirely prevented us
from judging whether we could reach it by a détour.
The choice lay between hunting for some such line or
else in trying what seemed on the whole more practicable,
viz. working round by the north-east face again,
so as to search for a more easy line of ascent.
But the latter alternative would have involved of
necessity a considerable descent. While we debated
what course to take the mists swept up thicker and
thicker from below, and in a moment the peak above
us was concealed and all the view cut off. A
piercingly cold wind began to rise and a sharp storm
<pb n='85'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>of hail and sleet descended. Hints were dropped
about the difficulty of descending rocks glazed over
with ice with a proper amount of deliberation. It
was obviously impossible to go up and might soon become
very difficult to go down. The question was not
actually put, but, in conformity with what was evidently
the general sense of the meeting, we somewhat reluctantly
made up our minds to return. A dwarf stone
man was constructed, the rope readjusted, and half an
hour’s descent put us out of the mist and snow. We
stopped again and stared upwards blankly at the leve
line of mist hanging heavily against the peak.
Burgener now came forward with a definite resolution
and proposed that we should stay where we were for
the night and try again the next day. This was referred
to a sub-committee, who reported against the
suggestion on the ground that the stock of provisions
left consisted of a tablespoonful of wine, four rolls,
and a small piece of cheese which had strayed from
the enveloping paper in the porter’s pocket and as a
consequence smelt of tobacco and was covered with hairs
and fluff. These articles of diet were spread on a
rock and we mentally calculated the exact proportion
that would fall to each man’s share if we attempted,
as proposed, to subsist on them for a day and a half.
But little deliberation was required. We decided at
once to return. The porter gathered the fragments
lovingly together and replaced them with other curious
<pb n='86'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>articles in his side pocket. By 8.30 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi> we were back
at Chamouni, having been out a little under twenty
hours.
</p>

<note place="margin">An adjournment</note>

<p>
A day or two later we made up our minds to start
once more. Great preparations were made for an
early departure, the idea that we should find it
distasteful to start at the hour at which a London
ball begins being scouted, as it usually is over-night.
We impressed on an intelligent <q>boots</q> with great
earnestness the absolute necessity of waking us precisely
at midnight, and then went to our repose, feeling
about as much inclined for sleep as a child does during
the afternoon siesta intended to prepare it for the
glories of a pantomime. The <q>boots</q> did not fail; in
fact he was extra-punctual, as our departure was the
signal for his retiring. At midnight the party
assembled in the little courtyard in front of the hotel,
but a dismal sight met our gaze. Under the influence
of a warm sou’-wester, thick black clouds had filled the
valley, and a gentle drizzle reminded us of the balmy
climate of our own metropolis in November. Our Alpine
tour for the season was nearly at an end, and we gazed
despondently around. Ultimately one practical person
suggested that if we did not go to the mountain we
might as well go to bed, and the practical person
endorsed his suggestion by walking off. A scurvy
practical joke did the clerk of the weather play on us
that night. In the morning the bright sunbeams
<pb n='87'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>came streaming in through the window, the sky was
cloudless and the outline of every peak was sharply
defined in the clear air. A more perfect morning for
the expedition could hardly have been chosen. Some
ill-timed remarks at breakfast referring pointedly to
people who talk a good deal over-night about early
starts, and the deep concern of the <q>boots</q> at our
presumed slothfulness, goaded us to desperation. We
determined to start again and to have one more try
the next day whatever the weather might prove to be.
Once more we found ourselves in the small hours of
the morning on the path leading to Les Ponts. Had
it not been for the previous day’s lesson we should
probably have turned back from this point, for the
whole of the mountain opposite was concealed in thick
drifting mist. The guides flatly refused to go on as
matters stood. We were determined on our side not
to give it up, and so a compromise was effected. It
was agreed to wait for an hour or two and see if
matters mended. So we stretched ourselves out on a
damp sloping rock, prepared to resume our journey
at the slightest indication of a change for the better.
Rest at such a time even under these hard, not to say
stony, conditions is seductive, and, as we lay half
dozing, strange heretical thoughts came crowding into
the mind. Why toil up this mountain when one can
rest in luxury on these knobby rocks? Why labour over
the shifting moraine, the deceitful glacier, the slippery
<pb n='88'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>rock? What is the good of it all? Can it be vanity
or——<q>Vorwärts!</q> The dream vanished as the cheery
cry broke out from the guide engaged on outpost duty,
and as we rose and stretched ourselves the whole
aspect of affairs seemed changed. A distinct break
in the clouds at the head of the Mer de Glace gave
promise of better things in store, and we felt almost
guilty of having wasted an hour or more at our halt.
The break became larger and larger, and before long
the great cloud banks resolved into one huge streamer
flying from the summit of the peak. I fancy that, at
any rate in the early stages of mountaineering, many
good chances are thrown away on such days, for
guides are as a rule somewhat prone to despondency
in the early morning hours. Once started, however,
they became wondrously keen, complained of our
delay, and even asserted with some effrontery that
they had predicted fine weather all the time, and this
without a blush; still some one rather neatly defined
blushing as a suffusion least seldom seen in those who
have the most occasion for it, and guides share with
politicians a certain power of manipulating their
opinions to suit the exigencies of the moment. The
traces of our former attempt assisted us materially
on the glacier. Our plan of attack consisted in getting
on the rocks at our former point, but working on this
occasion much more directly up the face. Burgener
conceived that by following this line of assault we
<pb n='89'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>should be able to ascend, by means of a gully which
existed only in his own imagination, to a more practicable
part of the peak. Between the two summits
of the Aiguille du Dru may be seen, at any rate in
photographs, a tempting-looking streak of snow: it
seemed possible, if we could once reach the lower
point of this streak, to follow its line upwards. The
lower peak of the Dru is well rounded on its eastern
face, and the rocks appear more broken than in other
parts of the mountain.
</p>

<note place="margin">The expedition resumed</note>

<p>
If we could but once reach the cleft between the
peaks there seemed every chance of our being able to
reach the lower summit. At the outset progress was
fast. We followed our former line till we were in sight
of the rock tower and then at once bore off to the right.
The climbing was rather more difficult, at least it
seemed so to us in those days, than on the other part
of the mountain with which we had previously made
acquaintance. A series of short flat gullies had to be
climbed, but there were exceedingly few inequalities to
help us. The rope was of little or no use and might
perhaps have been laid aside with advantage. We
soon found that we had reached a higher point than
at our previous attempt, and as the leader constantly
returned favourable reports our spirits rose; so elated
in fact did we become that the exact formalities to be
observed on reaching the top were seriously discussed
whenever the occasion offered for conversation, which
<pb n='90'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>was not very often. Old Franz chattered away to
himself, as was his wont when matters went well, and
on looking back on one occasion I perceived the
strange phenomenon of a smile illuminating the
porter’s features. Howbeit, this worthy spake no
words of satisfaction, but pulled ever at his empty pipe.
By dint of wriggling over a smooth sloping stone slab
we had got into a steep rock gully which promised to
lead us to a good height. Burgener, assisted by much
pushing and prodding from below and aided on his
own part by much snorting and some strong language,
had managed to climb on to a great overhanging
boulder that cut off the view from the rest of the
party below. As he disappeared from sight we
watched the paying out of the rope with as much
anxiety as a fisherman eyes his vanishing line when
the salmon runs. Presently the rope ceased to move
and we waited for a few moments in suspense. We
felt that the critical moment of the expedition had
arrived, and the fact that our own view was exceedingly
limited made us all the more anxious to hear the
verdict. <q>How does it look?</q> we called out. The
answer came back in patois, a bad sign in such emergencies.
For a minute or two an animated conversation
was kept up; then we decided to take another opinion
and accordingly hoisted up our second guide. The
chatter was redoubled. <q>What does it look like?</q> we
shouted again. <q>Not possible from where we are,</q>
<pb n='91'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>was the melancholy answer, and in a tone that crashed
at once all our previous elation. I could not find
words at the moment to express my disappointment:
but the porter could and gallantly he came to the
rescue. He opened his mouth for the first time and
spoke, and he said very loud indeed that it was
<q>verdammt.</q> Precisely: that is just what it was.
Having made this short speech, the porter allowed the
smile to fade away from his features, shook out some
imaginary ashes and proceeded to light some visionary
tobacco, sucking at a lighted match through the
medium of an empty pipe. It seemed hard to believe
at first that we were to be baulked when so near the
summit, and it was not till the guides had tried again
and again to storm the almost vertical wall of smooth
rock and had shown the utter impossibility of turning
it either right or left, that we felt we were really
beaten. One more forlorn chance remained: we
might try the west face of the mountain from the
spot we had reached at our first attempt, when the
weather had prevented us from making any further
progress. Had there been more time at our disposal
we should have done better to try another line of
ascent more to our right, that is, nearer to the col,
and it might be possible to reach the cleft between the
two summits by this means. As for the snow streak
which looked so tempting at a distance, it is a delusion
and a snare, if the latter term be applicable to a place
<pb n='92'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>which appears to be much more difficult to get into
than it probably would be to get out of. We had
already pretty fully realised that the mountain was
more difficult to ascend than we had ever contemplated,
and it seemed advisable at the moment to make for
some definite point which at any rate we felt sure of
reaching and to study the peak in detail to the best of
our ability; so we made towards our cairn, though
with little hope of gaining much knowledge thereby.
</p>

<note place="margin">A sticking point</note>

<p>
Without much difficulty, but not without some
little danger from falling stones (though on the whole,
the mountain is remarkably free from these annoyances,
there being as a matter of fact but few loose
stones to fall), we reached our former point and were
able to judge distinctly of how much higher we had
reached at our second attempt. We saw also that upward
progress from the point on which we stood would
not be possible, but it must be remembered that we were
able only to see a small strip of the mountain lying
directly above. Every crag that was not absolutely
vertical appeared to overhang, and the few small cracks
that might have afforded hand and foot hold led nowhere
in particular. Altogether the view was depressing
although limited. There was no time to hunt about
for other routes, or we should certainly have done so,
for we felt that though beaten our discomfiture only
arose from the fact that we had chosen a wrong line
of ascent. Possibly within a few yards of us lay a
<pb n='93'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>feasible route, but we knew not on which side it might
be. Here it occurred to the porter for the first time
that his pipe was empty and had been so all day: he
thereupon made his second remark, which consisted
in an audible request for something to put in it. We
had dragged up with us (as a matter of fact the
porter had carried it the whole time) some 200 feet of
rope, thinking it might help us in the descent, but the
part of the mountain on which we were presents no
more difficulties in this respect than does Avernus.
</p>

<note place="margin">Beaten back</note>

<p>
Arrived on the snow slope opposite the rock face
on which we had been climbing during the day, we
stopped, extended the telescope, and tried to make
out our exact line, and endeavoured also to discover
what had been our error; no easy task, as any persons
of experience will admit. At any time the appearance
of this peak is deceptive, and the outline no more
guides you to a knowledge of the natural details than
does the outline of a fashionable lady’s dress. But
as we looked the mountain seemed flattened out by
reason of a blue evening mist which obscured all
the irregularities. So we turned and resumed our
journey down, running hard across the Mer de Glace,
for the shades of night drew on apace, and reached
Chamouni at 8.30 in the evening, leaving the guides
at the Montanvert with half a bottle of thin red wine
between three of them. We were overtaken by Edouard
Cupelin, one of the best of the Chamouni guides, at
<pb n='94'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>any rate on rock mountains, on our way down, and he
gave us a rather sensational account of his own adventures
on the peak. In justice to him it should
be mentioned that he was almost the only Chamouni
guide who seemed to think the ascent possible, and in
his opinion the general line that we had adopted was
the correct one. Our second expedition thus from first
to last occupied about 20½ hours, but the halts were not
nearly so numerous as on the first occasion. The
experience of our two days’ climbing led us to the
conclusion that Cupelin was right. From the peculiar
character of the rocks and the fact that our
climbing lay chiefly along short flat gullies we were
unable, as already remarked, to get a very clear idea
of any part of the mountain except that on which
we were actually engaged, and we were led to the
opinion that the only plan to find a possible route
would consist in trying in succession from below the
different parts of the southern face. The final peak,
which from this side shoots up clearly defined from
the great mass of the mountain, seemed to us tolerably
easy of ascent provided one could reach the
base. A sort of depression extends three parts of the
way round, and the edge of this shallow moat appeared
to be defended by an inaccessible belt of vertical
rock. The actual rocks were wholly unlike any met with
elsewhere in our experience. Great vertical slabs were
fitted together with an accuracy which was beautiful
<pb n='95'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>in its perfection, but irritating beyond conception to
the climber. Progress upwards, when above the level
of the col, necessitated a series of fatiguing gymnastics
like swimming uphill, but the rocks where
they were possible proved invariably firm and good.
On both occasions we were stopped by sheer difficulty
and probably saw the mountain at its very best. The
snow on the rocks, which proved such a formidable
difficulty to Mr. Pendlebury’s party, had almost entirely
disappeared before our assault. The rocks were
warm and the weather on the second day was perfect.
</p>

<note place="margin">Results gained</note>

<p>
Such is the history of our first two attempts to
climb this mountain. They served but to whet our
appetite for success, but it was not till years after that
we were fortunate enough to meet with that success.

<p>
The summer season of 1878 was one of the worst
on record. Meteorologists, by a species of climatic
paradox, might have had a fine time of it; mountaineers
had a most wet and disagreeable time of it.
The weather prophets easily established a reputation
for infallibility—according to the accepted modern
standard of vaticination—by predicting invariably
evil things. They were thus right five times out of
six, which will readily be acknowledged as very creditable
in persons who were uninspired, save by a desire
<pb n='97'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>to exalt themselves in the eyes of their fellow tourists.
But, as in the case of that singularly hopeful person
Tantalus, the torture was rendered more artistic and
aggravating by sporadic promise of better things.
One day the rock aiguilles were powdered over and
white-speckled with snow. The climber looked up
longingly at the heights above, but visions of
numbing cold and frost-bitten fingers caused him to
thrust the latter members into his pockets and turn
away with a sigh, to put it mildly, and avert his gaze
from the chilling spectacle. Then would he follow his
daily practice—his thrice-a-daily practice in all probability—of
overeating himself. Perhaps, while still
engaged at <hi rend='italic'>table d’hôte</hi> in consuming, at any rate in
masticating, the multiform dish generically named
<q>chevreuil,</q> the glow of a rosy sunset, and the hope
of brighter things in store for the morrow, would
attract him to the window.
</p>

<note place="margin">Autres temps, autres mœurs</note>

<p>
The next day would produce scorching heat, a clear
sky, a rising barometer, and a revival of spirits; diet, as
the physicians say, as before. The powdered snow would
disappear off the ledges and, melting, distribute itself
more uniformly over the rocks, which as a result presented
a shining appearance, as the morning face of a
schoolboy or the Sunday face of a general servant. At
night a clear sky and a sharp frost in the high regions,
and the next day the mountain would be more impossible
than ever. Still, recognising that another few hours
<pb n='98'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>of grateful sunshine would cause the thin film of ice
glazing the rocks to melt and evaporate, the energetic
climber (and we were very energetic that year) would
summon his guides and all his resolution, pack up his
traps, and start for a bivouac up aloft, to return, in all
probability, at the end of twenty-four hours, in a downfall
of rain and in the condition of steamy moisture so
tersely described by Mr. Mantalini. Such, during July
1878, was our lot day after day in the glorious Alpine
climate. We paced up and down, with the regularity
of sentries, between our camp on the Aiguille du Dru
and Couttet’s hotel at Chamouni. Occasionally we
ascended some distance up the Glacier de la Charpoua
and took observations. Once or twice we proceeded
far enough on the rocks of the Aiguille du Dru to
prove the impossibility of ascending them to any
great height. Still we were loth to depart and run
the risk of losing a favourable opportunity of assaulting
the mountain with any chance of success. It fell
out thus that we had good opportunities of observing
our fellow creatures and the various types of travellers
who, notwithstanding the weather, still crowded into
Chamouni; for it was only on rock peaks such as the
Aiguille du Dru, or difficult mountains like the
Aiguille Verte, that climbing was impossible. This
condition of things did not affect to any very
appreciable extent the perambulating peasants who
constitute the vast majority of the body known as
<pb n='99'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>guides in Chamouni. These worthies merely loafed a
little more than they were wont to do, if that be
possible. Perhaps the gathering invariably to be
found, during twenty hours out of the twenty-four,
at the cross roads near Tairraz’s shop was still more
numerously attended, and there was some slight increase
in the number of sunburnt individuals who
found intellectual exercise sufficient to apologise for
their existence in wearing their hands in their pockets,
smoking indifferent tobacco, expectorating indiscriminately,
and uttering statements devoid of sense or
point to anybody who cared to listen. The weather
had no effect on them; whether wet or dry, cold or
warm, they still occupied themselves from June to
September in the same manner. Once in the early
morning, and once again about five o’clock in the
evening, were they momentarily galvanised out of their
listlessness by the arriving and departing diligences.
</p>

<note place="margin">The diligence arrives</note>

<p>
On the arrival of the caravan the contingent was
usually reinforced by some of our own countrymen.
The proper attitude for the English visitor at
Chamouni to assume, when watching the evening
incursion of tourists, consisted in leaning against the
wall on the south side of the street, and so to pose
himself as to indicate independence of the proceedings
and to wear an expression of indifference tinged with
a suggestion of cynical humour. This was usually
accomplished by wearing the hands in the pockets,
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>tilting the hat a little over the eyes, crossing the legs,
and laughing unduly at the remarks of companions,
whether audible or not. Some few considered that
smoking a wooden pipe assisted the realisation of the
effect intended: others apparently held that a heavy
object held in the mouth interfered with the expression.
I have observed that these same onlookers were bitterly
indignant at the ordeal they had to pass through on
returning to their native shores viâ Folkestone, when
clambering wearily with leaden eyes and sage-green
complexions up the pier steps. Yet the diligence
travellers, begrimed with dust, stung of horse flies,
cramped, choked, and so jolted that they recognised
more bony prominences than previous anatomical
knowledge had ever led them to expect they possessed,
were none the less objects of pity. Still human nature
is always worthy of study, and those who arrived,
together with those who went to see them arrive, were
equally interesting under the depressing climatic influences
which so often forbade us to take our pleasure
elsewhere.
</p>

<note place="margin">The Alpine habitue</note>

<p>
It was curious to note how, day after day, the diligence
on its arrival released from the cramped thraldom
of its uncomfortable seats almost exactly the same
load. As the great lumbering yellow vehicle came
within sight, one or two familiar faces would be seen
craning out to catch the first sight of an old guide or
mountain friend. These <hi rend='italic'>habitués</hi> as a rule secured
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>for themselves the corner seats. We knew exactly
what their luggage would be. A bundle of axes like
Roman <q>fasces</q> would be handed out first, with perhaps
a little unnecessary ostentation, followed by a coil
of rope which might have been packed up in the portmanteau,
but usually was not; then a knapsack, with
marks on the back like a map of the continent of
America if the owner was an old hand, and a spotless
minute check if he were only trying to look like
one. The owners of the knapsacks would be clad in
suits that once were dittos, flannel shirts and the
familiar British wide-awake, the new aspirants for
mountaineering fame decorating their head gear with
snow spectacles purchased in Geneva. Very business-like
would they show themselves in collecting their
luggage before anybody else; then, with a knowing
look at the mountains, they would make their way
to Couttet’s. Next, perhaps, would follow a party of
some two or three spinsters travelling alone and as
uncertain about their destination as they were of their
age. To attract such, some of the hotel proprietors,
more astute than their fellows, despatched to the
scene of action porters of cultivated manners and
obsequious demeanour, who seldom failed, by proving
themselves to be <q>such nice polite men, my dear,</q>
to ensnare the victims. Burdened with the numerous
parcels and odd little bags this class of traveller
greatly affects, the nicely mannered porter would lead
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>the way to the hotel or pension, probably bestowing,
as he passed, a wink on some friend among the guides,
who recognised at once the type of tourist that would
inevitably visit the Montanvert, probably the Chapeau
and possibly the Flégère, and recognising too the type
in whom judicious compliments were not likely to be
invested without satisfactory results. Such people
invariably enquired if they could not be taken <hi rend='italic'>en
pension</hi>. Somewhat frugal as regards diet, especially
breakfast, but with astounding capacities for swallowing
<hi rend='italic'>table d’hôte</hi> dinners or such romance as the
guides might be pleased to invent on the subject of
their own prowess and exploits. Charming old ladies
these often were, as pleased with the novelty of everything
they saw around them as a gutter child in a
country meadow. Their nature changes marvellously
in the Alps. Scarcely should we recognise in the
small wiry traveller in the mountains the same individual
whom we might meet in town—say in the
neighbourhood of Bloomsbury. I have noticed such
a one not a hundred miles from there whose energy
for sight-seeing when in the Alps surpassed all belief.
Yet here she seemed but a little, wrinkled, bent-in-the-back
old woman, flat of foot, reckless at crossings,
finding difficulty on Sunday mornings in fishing a
copper out of her reticule for the crossing sweeper, by
reason of the undue length of the finger-tips to her
one-buttoned black kid gloves, and accompanied on
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>week days, perhaps for the sake of contrast, by a
sprightly little black and tan dog of so arrogant a
disposition that it declined to use in walking all the
legs which Providence had furnished it. Next,
perhaps, the British paterfamilias, who might or might
not be a clergyman, most intractable of tourists; ever
prone to combine instruction with amusement for the
benefit of his bored family, slightly relaxing on week
days, but rigid and austere on Sundays beyond conception.
And then the foreign sub-Alpine walker or
<q>intrépide,</q> clad in special garments of local make
and highly vaunted efficiency, garrulous, smoky,
voracious, a trifle greasy, and dealing habitually in
ecstatic hendecasyllables expressive of admiration of
everything he saw. Next the family party, possibly
with a courier, with whom the younger members were,
as a rule, unduly familiar: the boys wearing tailed
shooting coats, consorting but ill with Eton turn-down
collars, groaning under the burden of green baize bags
containing assorted guide books, strange receptacles
for the umbrellas of the party, and with leathern
wallets slung around their shoulders, stuffed with the
useless articles boys cherish and love to carry with
them; the girls awkwardly conscious and feeling ill
at ease by reason of the practical dresses, boots, and
head gear devised for them at home, looking tenderly
after a collection of weakly sticks tipped with chamois
horns and decorated with a spirally arranged list of
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>localities; the whole party in an excessively bad
temper, which the boys exhibited by pummelling and
thumping when <q>pa</q> was not looking and the girls
by little sniffs, head tossings, and pointed remarks at
each other that they had no idea what guys they
looked. It will be observed that the constant bad
weather induced a cynical condition of mind.
</p>

<note place="margin">A family party</note>

<p>
We made up our minds, notwithstanding the
attractions of this varied company, to quit them for
a while, to seek fresh snow-fields and glaciers new,
and to leave the rocks of the Aiguille du Dru for a
time unmolested. At the suggestion of Jaun we betook
ourselves to the Oberland for a contemplated
ascent of the Bietschhorn by a new route. Under a
tropical sun we made our way by the interminable
zigzags through the Trient valley down to Vernayaz,
where we met again, like the witches in <q>Macbeth,</q> in
thunder and in rain. Our project was to ascend the
Bietschhorn from the Visp side and descend it by the
usual route to Ried. This form of novelty had become
so common in mountaineering that a new word had
been coined expressly to describe such expeditions,
and the climber, if he succeeded in his endeavour, was
said to have <q>colled</q> the peak. The phrase, however,
was only admissible on the first occasion, and it was
subsequently described by any who followed, in more
prosaic terms, as going up one side and down the other.
</p>

<note place="margin">A sepulchral bivouac</note>

<p>
We did not experience any unusual difficulty in
<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>leaving Visp tolerably early in the morning. The
chorus of frogs, who were in remarkably fine voice
that night in the neighbouring swamps, kept us
awake, and the proper musical contrast was provided
by the alto humming of some hungry mosquitoes.
Our plan of assault was to camp somewhere at the
head of the Baltschieder Thal, which is a dreary stony
valley with only a few huts that would scarcely be
considered habitable even by a London slum-landlord.
The living inhabitants appeared to consist of three
unkempt children, two pigs, one imbecile old man,
and a dog with a fortuitous family. On the whole,
therefore, we came to the conclusion that nature
would probably provide better accommodation than
the local architectural art, and a short search revealed
a most luxurious bivouac, close to the left moraine of
the Baltschieder Glacier, under the shelter of the
Fäschhorn and a little above the level of the ice fall.
A huge, flat slab of rock formed the roof of a wedge-shaped
cavity capable of holding at least six persons,
if disposed in a horizontal position. The space between
the floor and the roof, it is true, was not much
more than three feet; but the chamber, though well
sheltered, demanded no ventilating tubes to ensure a
proper supply of fresh air. Having a little spare time
and being luxuriously inclined, we decided to sleep on
spring beds. First we swept the stone floor, then
covered it with a thick layer of dry rhododendron
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>branches, over which were laid large sods of dried
peat grass, and the beds were complete. The pointed
ends of the twigs showed rather a tendency to penetrate
through the grassy covering during the night,
but otherwise the mattresses were all that could be
desired. About two in the morning we got up—that
is, we would have got up had it not been physically
impossible to do so by reason of the lowness of the
roof. A more correct expression would be perhaps to
say that we turned out, rolling from under the shelter
of the slab one after another. By the dim light of an
ineffective candle, poked into the neck of a broken
bottle, we found it no easy matter to collect all the
articles which the guides had of course unpacked
and stowed away as if they were going to stay a week;
indeed, a certain bottle of seltzer water will probably
still be found—at any rate the bottle will—by anyone
who seeks repose in the same quarters.
</p>

<note place="margin">On early starts</note>

<p>
We started in the usual frame of mind—that is to
say, everybody was exceedingly facetious for about
three minutes. In about ten minutes one of the
party, who would slake his thirst unduly at a crystal
spring near the bivouac the previous evening, found
that his boot lace was untied; circumstances which
do not seem associated at first sight, but are not,
nevertheless, infrequently observed. So again have
I often remarked that a good dinner overnight
develops in an astonishing manner admiration for
<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>distant views when ascending on the subsequent day.
Within a quarter of an hour the amateurs of the
party ceased to indulge in conversation, their remarks
dying away into a species of pained silence similar to
that which is induced in youthful voluptuaries by the
premature smoking of clay pipes. The guides, however,
seldom if ever desisted from dialogue, and never
for the purpose of listening to each other’s remarks.
Still, the respiratory process is governed by the
same conditions in the case of guides as in other
mortals, and though they would scorn to stoop to the
boot-lace subterfuge, and feel that a sudden admiration
for scenery would deceive no one, they yet found it
necessary before long to distribute their burdens more
equally; a process achieved by halting, untying
several strings, taking out several parcels and replacing
them in the same positions. By these
various methods we acquired what athletes call
<q>second wind</q> and stepped out more strongly. We
crossed a moraine of the usual inconsistency—however,
the subject of loose moraines has been, I fancy,
touched upon by other writers. The Baltschieder
Glacier sweeps at a right angle round a mountain
christened, not very originally, the Breithorn. This
particular member of that somewhat numerous family
blocks up the head of the Baltschieder Thal. We
skirted the north base of the Breithorn, passing between
it and the Jägihorn, and arriving at the top of a
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>steep little slope came in full view of the eastern
slopes of our objective peak. At this point Maurer
gave vent to a dismal wail of anguish as it suddenly
occurred to him that he had left the bottle of seltzer
water down below. With some difficulty did we persuade
him that it was not necessary to return for it,
although the idea of repose was not wholly distasteful,
but we felt that we had probably all our work cut out
for us in one sense, and that the days were none too
long for such an expedition as the one we had in hand.
Two distinct lines of attack appeared to offer themselves.
One route, more to our right, led upwards by
a gentle curved ridge, chiefly of snow, connecting the
Baltschieder Joch with the northern arête of the
mountain. In 1866 Messrs. D. W. Freshfield and
C. C. Tucker, as we learnt subsequently, attained a
high point by this way and were only prevented from
accomplishing the actual ascent by bad weather,
though they did enough to prove the practicability of
the route. However, this way, which appeared the
easier of the two, was evidently the longer from our
position. The other route had the advantage of lying
straight in front of us. Its attraction consisted of a
broad long gully of snow enclosed between two ridges
of rock. By the dim morning light the snow appeared
easy enough and was evidently in suitable condition:
howbeit, long snow couloirs, at the summit of which
rocks overhang, are not usually to be recommended
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>when the mountain itself is composed of friable
material. Now it would be difficult to find in the
whole of the Alps a mountain more disposed to cast
stones at its assailants than the Bietschhorn, a fact
of which we were fully aware. Every ascent of this
disintegrating peak so rearranges the rocks that the
next comers would not be wholly without justification
if they pleaded that the details of their ascent were to
a great extent new. Still, mountaineers up to the
present have not been quite reduced to such a far-fetched
claim to novelty, although in these latter days
they have at times come perilously near it. Judging
by the direction of the strata, we felt certain that the
rock ridges must be practicable, and the problem in
mountaineering set before us consisted in finding out
how we might best ascend without subjecting ourselves
to the inconveniences experienced by some of the early
martyrs.
</p>

<note place="margin">The rocks of the Bietschhorn</note>

<p>
An early breakfast put fresh strength into us.
It is a common mistake of mountaineers not to
breakfast early enough and not to breakfast often
enough. If it be desired to achieve a long expedition
when there is not likely to be too much spare time,
the wise man will eat something at least every two
hours up to about 10 o’clock in the morning, supposing,
for instance, he started about 2 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> It is
astonishing to notice how the full man gains upon
the empty one on fatiguing snow slopes. We strode
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>rapidly across the basin of snow called the Jägifirn
and arrived at the foot of the gully. But now we
could see that our suspicions were more than verified:
ugly-looking marks in the snow above indicated falling
stones, and the snow itself was obviously in a
condition prone to avalanches. This danger must
always be present in couloirs to a greater or less extent
in such seasons as the one we were experiencing.
There had been sufficient power of sun to convert the
contents of the gully into what would have been, in
fine weather, a glistening ice slope. But much fresh
snow had fallen recently. It but rarely can happen,
when snow has fallen late in the season or during the
hot months, that the new and the old layers can become
properly amalgamated. If, therefore, there is too
great a thickness of fresh snow to allow of steps being
cut through this into the ice beneath, such couloirs are
unsafe. The mark of a single avalanche due to the
sliding off of the fresh snow on the ice beneath—a
mark easily enough recognised—would deter any save
an unwise person or a novice from attempting such a
line of ascent. The marvellous hereditary instinct so
often attributed to guides in judging of this condition
really reduces itself to a matter of very simple observation
and attention, and one within the reach of
anybody. But travellers in the Alps too often appear
to treat their reasoning faculties like they do their tall
hats, and leave them at home. The question then
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>was, Were the rocks right or left of this snow gully
practicable? We all agreed that they were, and proceeded
at once to test the accuracy of our opinion.
</p>

<note place="margin">Avalanches on the Bietschhorn</note>

<p>
We crossed the bergschrund—that godsend to
writers on mountaineering in search of material to act
as padding—and without dwelling on its insecure bridge
longer than we need now dwell on the subject made
swiftly for some rocks on the left. Scarcely had we
gained them when a rush of snow and ice, of no great
dimensions, but still large enough to be formidable,
obliterated all the tracks we had just made. This
settled the point at once, and we felt that by the rocks
alone would it be proper to force the ascent. While
on the ridge we were safe enough, and had the advantage
as we clambered up of a most commanding position
from whence we could view the frequent avalanches
that swept by. The rain of the previous night, though
it had only lasted for an hour or two, had evidently
had a great effect on the state of the snow, and the
avalanches seemed to pour down almost incessantly:
probably some forty or fifty swept by us while we
climbed by the side of the gully, and our situation
gave rise to that feeling of somewhat pained security
which is experienced when standing on a railway
platform as an express train dashes by; we certainly
felt that some of the downfalls would have
reduced our party to a pulp quite as easily and with
as much unconcern as the train itself. The guides,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>who do not perhaps tax their memories very severely
for a parallel on such an occasion, asserted, as they
generally do, that they had never seen anything like
it in the whole course of their lives. They then fell to
whistling, laughed very gaily, and borrowed tobacco
from each other.
</p>

<note place="margin">A dramatic situation</note>

<p>
Gradually our difficulties became more pronounced,
and conversation on indifferent topics was discarded,
the remarks being confined to brief exclamations
such as <q>Keep it tight!</q> <q>Don’t touch that one!</q>
<q>Hold on now!</q> <q>You’re treading on my fingers!</q>
<q>The point of your axe is sticking into my stomach!</q>
and similar ejaculations. Once in a way we ascended
for a few feet by the snow, though never quite losing
touch of the rocks, and sank waist deep in the soft
compound filling up the gully. Then we went back to
the rotten rocks for a brief spell, well content to be
more out of the reach of chance fragments of ice
falling down the shoot. It is wonderful to note how
quickly time passes in an exciting climb of this nature;
but our progress was actually rather rapid, so fast
indeed that we did not fully realise at one period that
we were getting into difficulties and that we had without
doubt strayed, Christian-like, from the narrow
path which was evidently the right one. Throughout
the day we were conscious that the climb was too long
to be completed if we made any serious mistake involving
the retracing of steps. Quite suddenly, our
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>situation became critical: a hurried glance up and
down along the line revealed the fact that each
member of the party had to do all he knew to preserve
his position. The attitudes were ungainly enough to
suggest instantaneous photographs at an ill-selected
movement of four individuals dancing a <q>can-can.</q>
Maurer was engaged apparently in an extremely
close and minute inspection of the toe of his right
boot. Another member of the party was giving a
practical illustration of the fact that he could, by
extreme extension of his arms, stretch more than
his own height, while a third was endeavouring to find
out why the power of co-ordinating his muscular
movements was suddenly lost to him, and why he
could not persuade his left leg to join his right. For
a few moments Jaun, who was leading, hung on by his
finger-tips and the issue of the expedition hung in the
balance. But our leader, by dint of some <anchor id="corr113"/><corr sic="complicate">complicated</corr>
sprawls, transferred himself over a passage of rock on
which we had no earthly reason to be, and assisted
the rest of the party to regain a more promising line
of ascent. For those few minutes the situation was
dramatic enough, and the thought crossed my mind
that the curtain might not improbably descend on it;
a solution of the difficulty which commends itself to
the playwright when he has involved his <hi rend='italic'>dramatis personæ</hi>
in difficulties, but which is not without its
objections to the climber. On the whole the rocks on
<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>this face of the mountain are much more difficult than
on the other, and, writing now after the lapse of some
years, I am disposed to think that these are perhaps
the most difficult crags of any that I have ever met
with to climb properly, that is with a minimum of risk
to one’s self and to one’s companions; as a good
proof of this I may say that the ascent would probably
have appeared fairly easy to a novice and that it
required some little Alpine experience to realise their
real difficulty and their treacherous nature. There
was scarcely time to test adequately all hand and foothold,
and examination of rocks by what surgeons term
palpation is a <hi rend='italic'>sine quâ non</hi> in rock climbing. Undoubtedly
the mountain was not in the best possible
order. We may possibly have rearranged the rocks
in our line of ascent in a more convenient manner for
those who follow. Certainly we may fairly say that
in our actual line of ascent we left no stone unturned
to ensure success.
</p>

<note place="margin">The united party nearly fall out</note>

<p>
Close below the ridge—within perhaps ten feet of
it, for if I remember aright our leader had actually
reached the crest—came the climax to what was perhaps
rather a perilous climb. The first and second
on the rope had met in their upward passage a huge
cube of rock whose security they had carefully tested,
and to surmount which it was necessary to stretch
to the fullest extent in order to gain a respectable
hold for the hands. We were all four in a direct line
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>one below the other, and the two last on the rope were
placed perforce directly beneath the treacherous crag.
By an extension movement which conveyed some
notion of the sensation experienced by those on the
rack, I had reached a handhold pronounced to be of a
passable nature by those above. By this manœuvre
I succeeded in getting my feet exactly to a place on
which the others, who were much heavier than I, had
stood in security; without rhyme or reason the block
of stone, which was about the size of a grand pianoforte,
suddenly broke away from under me; a huge
gap seemed cloven out in the mountain side, and
Maurer, below, had only just time to spring aside,
enveloped in a cloud of dust, and to throw himself flat
against the rock, while the rope was strained to the
utmost. Fortunately the handhold above was sound
and I was able to hold on with feet dangling in the
air, searching in vain for some projection on which
to rest. Those above were too insecure to give any
efficient help, and in fact possibly viewed my struggles,
inasmuch as they were not fully aware at first of what
had happened, with as much equanimity as a person
inside a boat contemplates the gymnastic performances
of a bather trying to climb over the edge. As
the cloud of dust cleared off, however, and Maurer’s
face gradually beamed through it like the sun in a
fog, for the excitement had made him the colour of
a cornet player giving vent to a high note, they
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>began to realise that something abnormal had happened,
while the distant thundering reverberations of
the falling mass assured them that it was no ordinary
slip. Meanwhile Maurer planted his axe so as to give
me some foothold, and with a push from below and
a pull from above, fortunately simultaneous, I succeeded
in planting my feet where my hands were, and
subsequently undoubling found that we were within a
few feet of the ridge, that the panorama beyond was
undoubtedly magnificent, but was thrown out in strong
relief by deep blue-black thunder-clouds advancing
towards us.
</p>

<p>
Jaun now removed his empty pipe from his mouth
and replaced it by a lucifer match, which, either as an
aid to reflection or possibly for medicinal purposes, he
chewed as he contemplated the ridge. A miserably
cold wind with a remarkable knack of detecting all
the rents in our raiment whistled around; above, the
summit of the mountain was enveloped in driving
thick mist and cloud. Still the final ridge looked
fairly easy, and indeed proved to be so. The snow
was deep and soft, and the stones below were so
arranged as to remind us forcibly of a newly mended
road in our native country; big and little, all seemed
loose, and all arranged with their sharpest points and
edges uppermost. The ridge is moderately broad,
and we were able to flounder along with fair rapidity.
Spurred on by the unpromising look of the weather
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>and stimulated by the cold wind, which rendered any
halts so unpleasant as to be out of the question, we
set to work in earnest and found ourselves at the base
of the final little snow and rock cone earlier than the
length of the ridge had led us to expect. As we
stepped on to the summit we experienced the curious
sensation usually arising when climbing through
clouds, that the mountain itself was sinking away
rapidly from under our feet. The panorama was
wholly composed of a foreground consisting of mist,
and presented therefore comparatively few attractions.
</p>

<note place="margin">A limited panorama</note>

<p>
It was already so late in the afternoon that we
could not have afforded to stay in any case, and, as
we felt that serious difficulties might possibly be encountered
in descending, we set off at once, visions of
a warm welcome and a hot bath at Ried rising before
our minds. The idea of descending by way of the
Baltschieder Joch was negatived without a division.
The northern ridge of the Bietschhorn is a counterpart
of the one by which we had ascended, with the solitary
advantage in our case that we had to go down it and
not up. The snow slopes leading down to the Nest
Glacier were much broader, and we were strongly
tempted more than once to quit the ridge for this
western face of the mountain. Ultimately, persuaded
that the condition of the snow justified us in so doing,
we struck straight down on to the Nest Glacier, skirted
round the ridge of rocks dividing the Nest Glacier
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>from the Birch Glacier, and catching sight of a little
green patch some way below, threw off the rope and
rushed precipitately down to it. Misguided by a few
gleams of sunshine breaking out between the driving
clouds, we conceived the idea of repose and thought
that we might as well be aired and dried. Below,
the hotel at Ried was in full view, and it seemed
but an hour or two from us: but our troubles were
not yet over. The five minutes’ halt on such occasions
not uncommonly expand into five-and-fifty, and
we rather deliberately averted our gaze from the
western view of the valley, up which the thunder-clouds
were advancing steadily in close formation.
Eventually we decided to move on, in order to avoid
getting once more wet through. Vain hope: rapid
though our descent was to the level of the forest it
was not rapid enough. We ran furiously down the
rough slopes, but, as the storm advanced and we
perceived that we should be caught, the agitation of
our minds gradually equalled the agitation of our
bodies. We seemed to get no nearer Ried, while the
darkness increased rapidly around us. Knowing the
proclivities of guides on such occasions, my companion
and I agreed that nothing should induce us
to leave a path, should we perchance find one. Now,
in a dim light it is exceedingly easy to discover paths,
but extremely difficult to discover that variety of track
that leads anywhere. Determined, however, to stick
<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>to our resolution, we found ourselves continually
pursuing level stretches right and left, only to find
that, as routes to any particular place, they were
snares and delusions; that there was a path with
long zigzags we knew, and indeed, finally, a shout
from the guides, who skipped about downhill with an
utter disregard for the integrity of their joints, and
adopted that curious cantering gait considered on
the stage to express light-hearted joy, announced
that they had discovered the way. With characteristic
inconsistency, they had no sooner found what we
had been so long searching for than they proposed
to leave it and make short cuts, so called; but we
were inflexible, and determined not to leave our path
or be seduced by the attractions of a perpendicular
descent through an unknown territory. The hotel
lights were no longer visible, but we knew that they
lay straight below us. The question was whether we
should turn right or left. The guides settled the
matter by darting off ahead, ostensibly from a perfect
acquaintance with their situation, but actually as we
suspected to avoid being worried with unpleasant
topographical questions. Gradually as we followed
the track our stern purpose began to waver, for it
was pointed out by some one that the path, though
undoubtedly a good one in point of construction and
general purpose, had two distinct disadvantages from
our present point of view; one being that it led uphill,
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>and the other that it ran in the wrong direction.
There are certain contingencies in life in which the
Briton finds but one adequate method of relieving
and expressing his feelings, such, for instance, as
when he finds himself bespattered with mud from
the passing hansom on a carefully selected shirt-front
and a white tie that would have moved to envy; or
when, again, as the last to leave his club at night
he finds the only remaining head-gear to consist of
a well-worn beaver many sizes too large, with fur
under the brim and a decoration of little rosettes and
bobstays. It is hard to see why the ejaculation of
any particular monosyllable should do him good at
such a juncture. Hard words unquestionably break
no bones, but neither do they mend the broken collar-stud
or the ruptured bootlace; and yet if he swallows
the expression down it will certainly ferment within
him, and fermentation is characterised by multiplication.
If, on the contrary, he articulates his feelings,
the whole situation suddenly appears changed, and he
can view the most untoward circumstances once more
with a calm serenity of temper. But the remedy,
though potent, specific almost, is too valuable to be
resorted to constantly, and should be reserved, like
Thursday’s razor, for the most special occasions.
</p>

<note place="margin">A race for home</note>

<p>
Our situation on the present occasion fully justified
us in resorting to the source of relief vaguely alluded
to, and we employed it simultaneously with the
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>happiest results. Now the guides triumphed, and
such was our accommodating mood that we actually
acceded to their counsel and embarked on a perilous
descent down a vertical gully. Scarcely had we turned
into it when the storm broke and the rain came down
in sheets, and very damp sheets too. Some one now
suggested that the wisest plan would be to remain under
shelter till the rain had passed off. It was argued
against this amendment, and with a certain amount of
force, first that there was no probability of the rain
stopping, and secondly that there was no shelter: so
we went on. Gradually, as we became more wet, we
grew more desperate, and before long floundered down
as regardless of bumps as a bluebottle in a conservatory:
at one moment slithering over wet slabs of
rock to which damp tufts of moss were loosely adherent,
at another climbing carefully over gigantic toothcombs
of fallen trees, then plunging head foremost—sometimes
not exactly head foremost—through jungle-like
masses of long grass and dwarf brushwood. Soaked
to the skin, steamy, damp, and perspiring like bridegrooms,
we went on, utterly reckless as to our apparel,
and haunted by a perpetual idea that we should find
ourselves ultimately at some place whence further
descent would be impossible.
</p>

<note place="margin">Caught out</note>

<p>
Within a few minutes the party divided and Jaun
and I found ourselves together. By the lightning
flashes I saw him from time to time; on one occasion
<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>he suddenly disappeared from view, and on joining him
cautiously a little while after I found that he had
just previously seated himself abruptly on a flat rock,
immediately underneath a miniature torrent. The
fact that we did not at every ten seconds run against
large trees confirmed the idea that we were now
almost out of the wood; accordingly we halloaed, as
the occasion seemed suitable, but no answer was returned
from our companions. Now came the question
of how we were to cross the torrent which we knew
lay between us and the hotel. Jaun cheerfully remarked
that the best plan would be to find the bridge.
This was obvious enough, but he confessed that he
had forgotten at what part of the river’s course the
bridge lay. However, keeping close together, we
made towards the right, on which side the stream lay.
The slopes were here more level and less carelessly
laid out. Our hopes revived, for the hotel could
only be a few minutes off, and between the peals
of thunder we could hear the roar of the torrent and
could hear also the hollow sound due to the boulders
rolling over its stony bed. Of a sudden we came on
to its banks, and formidable enough the stream looked.
The idea of searching for the bridge seemed childish,
for the whole of the frail wooden structure had
probably been carried away long before down to the
Rhone valley. The hotel was only a few yards off,
and again the situation was exasperating enough to
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>justify a resort to extreme measures, if it were an
extreme measure to express forcibly a wish that the
torrent might be—well, temporarily stopped up at
some higher point. Jaun now volunteered to wade
across. It was quite unnecessary for him to divest
himself of any clothing for the purpose, and in fact
when he had succeeded very pluckily in reaching the
other side he was not in the least degree wetter than
when he started. He shouted some observations
from the other side, which I took to mean that he
would go on to the hotel and procure a lantern.
Accordingly I seated myself to await his return,
selecting unintentionally a little pool of water, which
however did just as well as anything else.
</p>

<note place="margin">The water jump</note>

<p>
Before long a flashing light advancing indicated
that Jaun had been successful, and two forms were
seen dimly on the opposite side, one with a light.
The bearer of the lantern was an aged person in shirt
sleeves and a highly excited frame of mind. The
aged person, on the distant shore, gesticulated as
violently as a marionette doll when its wires have got
hitched up wrong, and then, seemingly possessed of a
sudden fury, rushed violently down a steep place and
beckoned frantically with his lantern. This seemed
to mean that I was to descend to a point on the bank
opposite to where he stood. It now appeared that
there was a bridge within a few yards of us, if a
single spiky, submerged, and insecure trunk could be
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>considered such. The old man embraced me warmly
when I had made my way across, slapped me hard on
the back, and then laughed very loud and suddenly.
Then he darted off with the agility and abruptness of
movement of an elderly lady from the country crossing
in front of an omnibus, or a hen, a foolish animal
that always waits to the last moment before running
needlessly to the wrong side of the road. Guided by
the lantern which the impulsive veteran flourished
wildly in every direction, so that no one dared
approach him, in another ten minutes we reached the
hotel and found ourselves, with the exception of our
companions, who had arrived a few minutes before—Heaven
only knows how, for they did not—fortunately
the only occupants of the hotel. The volatile sexagenarian
calmed down, put on his coat, put out his
lantern, and retired to repose in an outhouse, a
shelter to which I fancy he was relegated owing to
certain physical infirmities.
</p>

<note place="margin">A classical banquet</note>

<p>
It was eleven o’clock, and we had been pretty
actively employed for twenty-one hours. The idea of
food and a change of raiment was not, therefore, distasteful.
A middle-aged female with an excessively
<q>rational</q> and hygienic waist, who said she was the
waitress, volunteered to serve the banquet, but the
change of raiment necessary was naturally beyond her
means, while the idea of borrowing from the aged
person’s wardrobe did not commend itself to us, so we
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>ordered in a large stock of towels. <q>But,</q> I remarked,
<q>you can’t go about in a bath towel</q>—the truth of
which assertion was immediately evident, for they were
so small that it was difficult to fasten them with any
degree of security; accordingly blankets were requisitioned,
and a very classical effect in costume was thus
produced, though what the Romans did when there
was a gale of wind I do not know. To keep up the
delusion we arranged the chairs after the fashion of
couches, and appeased our hunger with a curious repast
of stewed apples and mixed biscuits, the sole articles
of food that could be discovered. However, to anticipate,
we fared better the next day at breakfast; for
though Bright Chanticleer proclaimed the morn at
3 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> he did not proclaim any subsequent period of
time, as he was captured and cooked for our repast.
The waitress while we supped was busily engaged in
stoking up the stove, and seized upon our damp
raiment with avidity to have it ready for the next
morning; so energetic was she in fact that we felt it
necessary to remonstrate, foreseeing the probability
that our clothes might have to be brought back to us
in a dust shovel: we remarked that, though sorry for
our misdeeds, we would limit for choice the repentant
nature of our apparel to the sackcloth we were then
wearing and would dispense with the adjunct of ashes.
The unreliable nature of the fastenings of our costume
prevented us from accompanying our forcible remarks
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>with properly impressive gestures. The remonstrance,
however, had the desired effect, and our garments the
next day, though somewhat shrivelled and inconveniently
tight here and there, still proved that they
had resisted effectively the fire as well as the water.
</p>
<note place="margin">The old cure</note>
<p>
The amount of luxury found in the Lötschthal since
those days has materially improved. Time was when
the only accommodation for the traveller was to be
found at the humble tenement of Mons. le Curé, a
worthy old creature as I remember him, who appeared
to keep an apiary in his back drawing-room and was
wont to produce the most excellent honey and the
most uncompromising bread; the latter article, as
one might judge, was baked about as often as the old
gentleman washed himself. But the milk of human
kindness flowed strongly in him (as it may be said to
do in those who have been made the subjects of
transfusion), though, to tell the truth, it was somewhat
decidedly flavoured with garlic, and it needed
much resolution to attentively listen to the confidential
communications he was in the habit of whispering.
A man of education and gentle refinement—at any
rate of mind—his was a hard lot, buried away in a
squalid little parish, with no earthly being to talk to
possessed of more than one idea; yet he slaved on
contentedly enough with no thought beyond the
peasants in his own district and of how he might
relieve their condition, too often at the expense of his
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>own welfare; isolated more than any ascetic, for his
mental existence was that of a hermit, from circumstances
and not from will. The thought of solitary
confinement is terrible, but utter mental isolation is
hideous. Yet, while he entertained us hospitably with
fare which, though rough, was the very best he could
offer, he would not join in the repast: not, probably,
from lack of appetite, but from a feeling that, owing
to prolonged seclusion and association with the
peasants, the more fashionable and accepted methods
of preparing food for consumption and conveying it
to the mouth, with subsequent details, were somewhat
dim to his recollection. Yet his conversation flowed
fast and he talked well: the while any reference to
friends and fellow-travellers would cause him to pause
for a moment or two, look upwards around the room,
and fetch a rather long breath before he recommenced.
A curiously gaunt old creature he seemed at first
sight: with wonderful, bony, plastic hands capable of
expressing anything; grotesque almost in his unkempt
rustiness; provoking a smile at first, but sadness as
one learnt more of him. And how closely are the two
emotions associated. In truth Humour was born a
twin, and her sister was christened Pathos.
</p>

<p>
I can recall that he accepted a sum of ten francs
when we parted in the morning. His eyes glistened
with pleasure as he took the coin and straightway
made for a ramshackle hovel on the hill-side, where
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>lay an aged person <q>très-malade.</q> Possibly after his
visit there was left a happy peasant in that tumble-down
cabin—an emotional object more often described
than witnessed. But all this took place years ago,
and as we passed the collection of dilapidated tenements
in one of which our old friend once lived, I
failed to recognise his former dwelling-place. The
timbers grew old and worn, the bands rusty, and one
day the wheel which had worked steadily for so long
stopped. Yet the stream which had moved it ran on
as if nothing had happened. Was it a wasted life?
Who can say if there be such a thing?

</lg>
    <p>We passed on: in a few minutes the houses were lost
to view and there was left but the reflection of how
much more, worthy of study, there was in this old
curé’s nature than in the majority of Swiss with
whom mountaineering brings us in close contact.
</p>

<note place="margin">A <q>pension</q> in a train</note>

<p>
As we descended the Lötschthal to Gampel the
air seemed to thicken. The excessive warmth allowed
our garments to stretch once again to their wonted
girth, and we became less thoughtful. The vignette
of the ancient curé dissolved away and was replaced
by a view (mental only, unhappily) of our aiguille at
Chamouni, black and bare of snow, inviting another
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>attack. Gampel does not tempt the traveller much
to seek repose, and we therefore caught the first train
that came crawling along the valley and shaped
our course for Chamouni in a second-class carriage
tenanted by a <hi rend='italic'>pension</hi> of young ladies out for a holiday
apparently, who all chirped and twittered and wrangled
for the best places till the going down of the sun,
like the Temple sparrows.

<p>
It was the summer of 18— and our old quarters at
Couttet’s hotel knew us once more. As we drove into
the village of Chamouni we turned our heads carelessly
around to note the various new hotels that might have
arisen since our last visit. Observing that they were
four or five in number, we rightly conjectured that
we should find all the hotel keepers complaining
bitterly of the hard times and the want of custom.
Also we wondered in how many ways it was possible
to build a house without any particular system of
drainage, a deficiency which was at that time
becom<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>ing very marked in Chamouni, but has since, I believe,
been improved. Yet the place itself had not altered
essentially. New buildings of imposing exterior and
little else do not materially alter a place that leads a
life like that of modern Chamouni. The population,
which throughout the summer appears to pass its
time in the streets with its hands in its pockets, was
still amusing itself in the same way. The tone of the
village was just the same as we had always known it,
and even M. Couttet himself had not succeeded in
imparting any marine flavour by building an odd little
lighthouse with an iron flag on the top which the
architect had ingeniously represented as streaming
permanently in a direction indicating a wind favourable
for fine weather. We knew that we should find
the same denizens in the hotel; and they were there.
</p>

<note place="margin">A youthful
hero</note>

<p>
There was a very young man with a very parti-coloured
face from exposure on the glaciers, who had
recently completed the thousand-and-first ascent of
Mont Blanc and was perpetually posing gracefully
against the door-post or in a lattice-work summer-house
a few steps from the hotel, gazing towards the
mountain and rather eagerly joining in any conversation
relating to the perils of the ascent. There were
three or four young ladies of various periods of life
who gazed at him with admiration and enquired at intervals
if he wasn’t very tired; to which the young man
replied carelessly that he was not, and inwardly thought
<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>that the discomfort of sunburn and the consequent
desquamation was on the whole cheaply bought, the
while he wished the expedition had not cost so much
and that so many others had not thought of making
the same ascent. And then there came a lithe, active
lady walker who had been up Mont Blanc and a great
many other mountains too, and paid no more attention
to the guides’ stereotyped compliments than a
suspicious dog does to those of a nervous visitor: so
the young man’s nose was put out of joint and he would
have laughed scornfully at the fickleness of hero worship
had not the skin of his face been in danger of
cracking, and he wished his shirt collar had not been
starched and thumped by the village washerwoman into
the form of a circular linen saw.
</p>

<note place="margin">A scientific gentleman</note>

<p>
Then there was an excitable Englishman of impulsive
habits, with a large family who were perpetually
playing a game of follow-my-leader with their parent,
and who were under orders to weigh anchor on the
following morning at five o’clock for the Montanvert
and the Mauvais Pas. The boys were stoking up for
the occasion with raw apples, and the girls were occupied,
when not pursuing their restless father, in preparing
a puggaree for his hat. There was a gentleman
who affected the curious untidiness of raiment not
unfrequently noticed among Sunday frequenters of
the Thames, and who sought to establish a mountaineering
reputation by constantly gazing at the peaks
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>around in a knowing manner and wearing a flannel
shirt of an obtrusive pattern destitute of any collar.
There were guides about, who were on the point of
being paid for their services and who were exceedingly
polite and obsequious; others whose <q>tour</q> had just
passed, were, proportionately, less deferential. There
was an elderly lady whose whole soul appeared bent
on a little stocking from which she never parted,
and who turned the knitting needles to more account
for toilet and other small purposes than I could have
conceived to be possible. There were two or three
mountaineers who appeared anxious only to avoid
everyone’s gaze and who might be seen in byways and
odd corners talking to bronzed guides who looked like
business. Finally, there was a gentleman of statistical
and scientific tendencies, much given to making quietly
astonishing statements of astronomical facts and
gently smiling as he rolled over his tongue and enjoyed
the flavour of the vast numbers with which it
was his pleasure to deal. He absolutely revelled and
wallowed in figures. Buttonholed in a corner and
compelled to listen with deferential attention, I secretly
writhed as he crushed me slowly with the mere weight
of his numerals. He shared with others of his frame
of mind the peculiarity of always keeping something
in hand and skilfully working up to a climax. Such
and such a star was so many millions of miles off.
We opened our eyes to the proper degree of width and
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>observed, <q>Bless me!</q> or, <q>You don’t say so?</q> Instantly
he would rejoin, <q>Ah, but that’s nothing to
so and so,</q> and then favoured us with a still more
immeasurable distance. We expressed a slightly
greater degree of intelligent amazement. Thereupon
he nodded his head, gently inclined it a little to one
side, and smiled softly. It gave him such evident
pleasure to have a listener that I attended with due
reverence to his enthusiastic computations; knowing
my man, I felt sure that he was keeping back a real
staggerer to finish up with, and was prepared to
assume varying degrees of surprise up to the moment
when it should come. Unfortunately I misjudged its
advent, and feeling that I had somewhat lost in his
estimation by evincing undue astonishment at a comparatively
small array of figures, I sought to turn the
conversation by requesting to know how long he
thought it might be before the great rock peaks around
us would have crumbled away to their bases. The
calculation was too trivial and the number of millions
of generations too small to interest him much, but he
vouchsafed an approximate estimate.
</p>

<note place="margin">A dream of the future</note>

<p>
I let him babble on and fell a-thinking. The peaks
were crumbling away bit by bit no doubt, the glaciers
shrinking. At a bound the mind leapt into a future
which, after all, might be not so very unlike a past.
The Alps things of the past! What, I wondered,
when the mountains were all levelled down and
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>smiling valleys occupied the troughs of the glaciers
of to-day, would some future commentators make of
the literature so industriously piled up by the members
and followers of the Alpine Club? Imagination ran
riot as in a dream, and I fancied some enthusiast
exploring the buried city of the second Babylon and
excavating the ruins of the <q>finest site in Europe.</q>
I pictured to myself the surprise in store for him on
digging out the effigies of some of our naval and
military heroes, and the mingled feelings with which he
would contemplate the unearthed statue of George IV.
It seemed possible that in that far-off epoch to which
my friend’s calculations had borne me, the Alpine Club
itself might have ceased to exist. Pursuing his explorations
in an easterly direction, the excavator
might perchance have lighted on a strange tunnel,
almost Arcadian in its simplicity of design, and
marvelled at the curious and cheap idols of wax and
wood which the people of that ancient day had evidently
worshipped. Turning north again, this Schliemann
of the future would pass by the ruins of
S. Martin’s Church, eager to light upon the precious
archives of the historic Alpine Club itself. How
eagerly he would peruse the lore contained in the
Club library, anxious to decipher the inscriptions
and discover what manner of men they were who
lived and climbed when mountains and glaciers were
still to be found on this planet. Human nature would
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>probably not have changed much, and the successful
explorer might even have been asked to favour a
scientific society of the future with the result of his
discoveries, to which in all probability he would have
acceded, with a degree of reluctance not quite sufficient
to deter the secretary of the society from pressing
him.
</p>

<note place="margin">A condensed mountain ascent</note>

<p>
An abstract of his description of our sibylline
leaves I fancied might run somewhat in this style:—After
commenting on the fact that the maps and
illustrations did not usually correspond in number
with the list set forth in the index of the volumes
unearthed, he might proceed thus:—<q>In pursuit of
their great and glorious object these ancient heroes
appear to have undergone vast personal discomfort.
It is difficult therefore to realise fully why so many
engaged in this form of exploration. Instances
have been given by other learned antiquarians who
have studied the habits of this people, of a similar
purposeless disregard of comfort, such as the four-wheeled
wooden boxes in which they travelled about,
the seats in their churches, &amp;c. The outset of their
expedition was almost invariably characterised by a
display of bad temper, attributed to early rising.
After a varying number of hours of excessive toil
the travellers were wont to arrive at some fearsome
chasm spoken of as a <q>bergschrund.</q> On this, if the
subject-matter of their narrative was insufficient in
<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>quantity, they were wont to descant and enlarge at
length; sometimes, as we judge, in their descriptions
they enlarged the bergschrund itself. They then
crossed it. Immediately after this incident they were
in the habit of eating, and the minute and instructive
details commonly given enable us to form
a tolerably accurate opinion as to the nature of the
diet with which they supported their exhausted
frames. Next they traversed strange localities for
which there appear to have been no adequately descriptive
expressions in their own language. In fact the
difficulty of deciphering these records is greatly increased
by the fact that the writers were versatile
linguists, for they constantly make use of words of
a hybrid character. They were evidently practised
meteorologists and took much interest in this subject,
as may be gathered throughout from their writings. At
length they reached summits, of the nature of which we
in our time can have but a feeble conception. So great
was their relief at the termination of their self-imposed
but toilsome task, that they habitually burst
forth into language characterised by a wealth of
imagery and a fervour of poetic description which
unfortunately conveys but little idea to us in our day
of what they actually saw. In descending they were
all commonly within an ace of meeting with a violent
death. The mode in which the danger attacked them
varied within certain restricted limits, but it always
<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>occurred and the escape was always narrow. The
peril over, they remarked that they breathed freely
again, and then at once fell to eating. Arrived at a
successful termination of their wearisome labour, they
advised others to do the same. They dealt out unsparing
satire to their companions, unlimited praise
to their guides, and unmeasured ridicule to their
porter. They commonly expressed throughout their
descriptions grave doubts and uncertainty as to the
issue of the expedition: a curious and noteworthy
fact, for the heading of the accounts always divulged
at the outset their ultimate success. The construction,
therefore, of their narratives was in accordance with a
well-recognised model and appeared capable of little
variation. The only other facts that we can glean
are that they were prodigious eaters, were much
pestered by some extinct species of insects, and that
they make frequent allusions to a substance termed
tobacco. The constant repetition of these incidents
stamps upon their writings the impress of unexaggerated
veracity. Still they were not universally
held in favour, indeed were regarded with disapprobation
by some individuals of their own race. It would
seem indeed from internal evidence that, had it not
been for frequent and sharp criticism of their proceedings,
their pastime might never have inveigled so
many persons with its seductive fascination.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now at the time at which these prophetic fancies
<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>were conjured up we had just completed an expedition
which it seemed might be worthy of attention, solely
on the ground of its very contradictoriness. For the
features of this climb were most opposed to those
already mentioned, and in fact mention of it scarcely
seemed admissible in an Alpine narrative. We took
no porter with us to fill the rôle of first low comedy
man. We had very little to eat; our stock of wine
ran out through a leaky gourd; our tobacco was wet
and there was no bergschrund, and yet all this
happened on a mountain close to Chamouni.
</p>

<note place="margin">Wanted, a programme</note>

<p>
<q>Some vast amount of years ago, ere all my youth
had vanished from me,</q> as the poet says, at a date
therefore which for obvious reasons it is inexpedient
here to mention, I found myself, as already mentioned,
at Chamouni. With me was an old mountain friend
and fellow climber, J. Oakley Maund. We were both
burning with desire to add to the list of the many
successful expeditions we had made together, but, as
a matter of fact, were somewhat gravelled for lack of
suitable matter. Like a ministry on the eve of a
general election or a gentleman without a sixpenny-piece
at a theatre, we were sorely in need of a programme.
The locality was somewhat unfortunately
chosen for those in whom the ancient spirit was not
yet quite extinct and who wanted to do something new.
Ever since the days when Jacques Balmat, Dr. Paccard,
and the great De Saussure had donned strange apparel
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>and shown the way—that is to say, for nearly a hundred
years—people had been climbing mountains in the
district, and it was not to be wondered at if it were
hard to find some expedition which nobody else had
thought of, or, worse still, had achieved. We gazed
at the map and made thumb marks all over it. In
every conceivable direction ran little lines indicative
of previous explorations. We studied the <hi rend='italic'>carte en
relief</hi>, but without much hope of getting any information
of value from this inaccurate and lumpy
absurdity. Mont Blanc, which, according to this work
of plastic art, was modelled out as some eight or ten
thousand feet higher than any other point of the chain,
had had all the snow worn off its summit by much
fingering, so that the component pasteboard showed
through. Rivers ran uphill in this map, and lakes
were inclined at an angle; bits of sticking plaister represented
towns and villages, and the whole article was
absolutely bristling with little spikes and points like
the old panoramas of London or the docks at Liverpool.
Still a considerable number of people seemed
willing enough to pay fifty centimes for the pleasure
of indicating elaborate expeditions on it with their
fore-fingers, and appeared to derive pleasure from
gazing on a pasteboard misrepresentation when they
could by looking out of window see the real thing for
nothing. We abandoned the <hi rend='italic'>carte en relief</hi> and took
Jaun and Kaspar Maurer into our confidence. The
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>only suggestions that they could make were the
Aiguille des Charmoz and the Dent du Géant. The
former of these two peaks we had both tried to
ascend in former seasons, without success. Jaun did
not think then that it was possible, and without
sharing his opinion we gave way to it. With regard to
the latter mountain we all thought at the time that an
undue amount of what is vaguely termed <q>artificial
aid</q> would be necessary to ensure success, an opinion
confirmed by subsequent events, for when Signor
Sella achieved the honour of the first ascent he was
only able to accomplish it by somewhat elaborate
engineering appliances. Some bold person of an
original turn of thought suggested of course a variation
of some way up Mont Blanc, but the utter impossibility
of discovering the slightest deviation from
any previously ascended route and the utter uselessness
of trying to find one caused a general shout of
derision, and the bold person thereupon withdrew his
suggestion and ordered some coffee. Besides, the
weather was fine; every day swarms of tourists
could be seen, crawling up the sides of the monarch
of mountains, in numbers as many as the flies on a
sugar loaf in a grocer’s window on a hot day.
</p>

<p>
One evening we sat in front of Couttet’s hotel
staring pensively at the familiar outline of the row
of aiguilles, and wishing we had lived in the days of
Albert Smith, the best friend Chamouni ever had.
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>At any rate, at that time the natives were unsophisticated
and the mountains about were not all done to
death. The valley between us and the chain was
filled with a light haze, not sufficient to conceal the
outline of the mountains but yet enough to blot out
their detail and solidity. As the moon rose behind
the chain we saw a strange phenomenon. A silhouette
was thrown forwards on to the curtain of haze
and photographed on it with sharp and clear definition,
so that we could recognise, at an immense
height, the shadowed peaks looking almost as massive
as the actual mountains. Nor was this all; a second
curtain of mist seemed to be suspended, in a vertical
stratum, in front of the former one, and the shadows
were again marked out on this, infinitely more magnified
and less distinct, but still perfectly recognisable.
As a result we were able to see the semblance of three
distinct tiers of mountains one above the other, looking
so massive that we could scarcely realise that they
were but transparent ghosts of the peaks; and the
phenomenon, a double <q>Brocken,</q> must have lasted
for more than half an hour. However, we desired
something more of the nature of the substance than
the shadow, and ultimately came to the conclusion
that it was absolutely necessary for our peace of mind
to accomplish something on the morrow, and as it
really mattered but little what that something might
be, provided a good climb was afforded, we must yield
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>to circumstances and perforce adopt the latter-day
necessity of all mountaineers. If we could not find the
right way up some new mountain we could at least
take the wrong way up an old one.
</p>

<note place="margin">The Aiguille du Midi</note>

<p>
So the next morning we walked up to the Pierre
Pointue as a preliminary step—a good many and
rather arduous steps—towards the object in view.
The exertion of toiling up the zigzags or the more
rarefied atmosphere had a remarkable effect on one of
the party, whose face when we reached the chalet was
found to be wreathed in smiles and wearing an expression
of great intelligence. He had in fact become
possessed of an idea. Bubbling over with self-satisfied
chuckles, he suggested that we should ascend the
Aiguille du Midi by the face directly in front of us
and then descend on the other side, thus making a
col of the mountain. The idea found favour instantly,
and the intelligent person was so much pleased that
he ordered a bottle of wine, plastered over with a very
costly variety of label, and regretted it. Investigation
of the cellar revealed only two casks of wine, but the
<q>carte</q> comprised a long list of various vintages.
Fired with enthusiasm and inflated with <hi rend='italic'>limonade
gazeuse</hi>, we left the chalet and strode vigorously up
the hill in order to prospect the route and reconnoitre
the rocks. The exertion and the pace soon told upon
us, the sooner that it was a hot, enervating day;
the kind of day that makes one perforce admire the
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>ingenious benevolence of nature in fashioning out on
the grassy slopes rounded inequalities, exactly adapted
to those of the human figure in a seated or recumbent
position. The heated air rising from the ground gave
flickering and distorted views of distant objects, like
unto marine phenomena viewed through the cheap
panes of a seaside lodging-house window. The grasshoppers
were extraordinarily busy; the bees droned
through the heavy air; the ants, overcome apparently
by the temperature, had given up for the time straining
their jaws by their foolish practice of carrying
large parcels about without any definite object, and
had retired to the shady seclusion of their own
heaped-up residences; the turf was most inviting.
It now occurred to us that there was no absolute
necessity for the whole party to ascend on the present
occasion, and that perhaps the guides might go up
quicker alone. The details of this suggestion were
acceded to on the part of the amateurs of the party
with astonishing alacrity and unanimity. We laid
the scheme before the guides, and they also thought
it a very fine one. Thereupon, with much parade
and ceremony, they braced themselves up for great
exertion, borrowed the telescope, remarked that they
expected to be back some time during the night, and
started upwards with somewhat over-acted eagerness.
My companion and I disposed ourselves comfortably
in the shade, and resumed an argument which had
<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>originally commenced some days previously. I waxed
eloquent on the subject under discussion and with
much success, for such was the force of my logic and
the cogency of my reasoning that I bore down on
my opponent, and reduced him in a short time to absolute
silence, from which he did not awake for nearly
two hours.
</p>

<note place="margin">Ephemeral acquaintances</note>

<p>
About this time the guides, who in all probability
had also been comfortably asleep within a
short distance of us, returned and gave a favourable
report concerning the mountain. Elated by this news,
we climbed a short distance further up, and met there
a large party of ephemeral acquaintances who were
taking an afternoon’s pleasure on the hills. After the
manner of people when so engaged, they set forth
with great energy and climbed up a steep little rock
tump a few hundred yards distant. Arrived at the
summit, they roared out unintelligible remarks to us,
and we did the same to them till we were hoarse; we
waved our hands and hats and they flourished their
handkerchiefs as if they were our dearest friends on
earth, just setting out on an emigrant ship for the
Antipodes. The party then descended; the nearer
they came the less friendly and demonstrative were
we, and by the time we met the warmth of affection
recently manifested on both sides had wholly evaporated,
and we conversed in ordinary tones on indifferent
topics. Then they set out for another little hill,
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>and we were moved, apparently by some uncontrollable
impulse, to go through the same idiotic performance.
Emotional behaviour of a similar kind is not infrequently
observed in the mountains. We journeyed
together back to the Pierre Pointue, viewing each
other with distrust and suspicion; and when it was
found that we had bespoken the beds—if the exaggerated
packing-cases lined with straw bags could be
considered such—we parted on terms the reverse
of friendly. So frail are the links that bind human
affections.
</p>

<note place="margin">A familiar character</note>

<p>
Standing in front of the hut was a type of
character very familiar in these tourist-frequented
districts. His exterior was unpromising; his beard of
a fortnight’s growth, or thereabouts, somewhat fitful
withal and lacking in uniformity of development. A
hard hat, with a shining green veil folded around its
battered outline, decorated his head; his raiment was
black and rusty, his legs cased in canvas gaiters
fastened with many little girths and buckles, and in
his right hand he grasped a trusty three-franc pole
made of wainy deal, and surmounted at the top by a
brown knob similar to those which come out suddenly
when we try to open a chest of drawers in a cheap
lodging. He fidgeted about for a while, asked questions
in a rather loud tone of voice at us, and we felt
that it was his intention to enter into conversation.
It was even so. After a while he sidled up and
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>requested with much diffidence to be informed what
we proposed to climb on the morrow. Now the true
mountaineer, however amiable his disposition, always
shrinks up into his shell when such a question is put
to him on the eve of an expedition. My companion
indicated by a sweep of the arm a space of territory
extending about from the Mont Buet on the one side
round to the Aiguille de Gouté on the other. Our
friend surveyed from end to end the extensive
panorama suggested, then looked seriously at us and
observed that we should probably find it a fine walk.
We expressed gravely the opinion that he was quite
right, and then went in to dinner, while our composite
friend expatiated on the project to his companions as
an expedition but little out of the ordinary run, and
one that he was perfectly prepared to undertake himself
if so disposed; then he resumed his contemplation
of a rock some ninety feet or so in height jutting out
through the glacier above, which he was under the
impression was a lady descending from Mont Blanc.
We did not learn his name, but the individual may,
nevertheless, possibly be recognised. Some points of the
argument were still unsettled when we climbed over
the edges of our respective boxes and vanished into
the strawy depths below. The clear moonlight
streamed in through the window and prevented sleep;
so I lay in my wooden box thinking over the recent
discussion, but with such a distinct
intention—<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>like little Paul Dombey with Mrs. Pipchin—of
fixing my companion presently, that even that hardy
old mountaineer deemed it prudent to counterfeit
slumber.
</p>

<p>
In the small hours of the morning we got under
weigh. For some time we had been leading a life of
sloth in Chamouni, and the delight of finding ourselves
once more on the mountain path, and making
for a rock climb, entirely precluded that fractiousness
which, as all readers of Alpine literature know, ought
properly to be described at this period of an expedition.
The path was irregular and demanded some equanimity,
for the stumbling-blocks were innumerable
and artfully placed to trip up the unwary in an
aggravating manner. Feeling it unfair that all the
work should be thrown on the guides, I had volunteered,
rather magnanimously, to bear part of the
burden, and selected the lantern as my share. By
this means it was not only possible to walk in comfort
over a well-lighted track, but the bearer was enabled also
to regulate the pace to a speed convenient to his own
feelings. Before long, however, we reached the lower
snow patches of the Glacier des Pélèrins, and the
light was no longer necessary.
</p>

<note place="margin">Halting doubts and fears</note>

<p>
We made straight across the crisp snow to the base
of a promising-looking rock buttress lying to the right
of the snow gully that runs up the side of the mountain,
feeling sure that either by the rocks or the snow a
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>way up could be found. And now I am painfully conscious
of a glaring defect in this Alpine narrative. A
mountain ascent without a bergschrund is as tame as a
steeplechase without a water jump, but candour compels
the admission that no bergschrund was visible.
Either we had hit on a spot where the orthodox chasm
was filled up for the time, or else this particular
glacier was an exception to all others previously
treated of in mountain literature. In a few seconds
we found ourselves on the rocks, delighted to exchange
the monotonous mode of progression compulsory on
snow for the varied gymnastic exercises demanded on
rocks. The sun had risen, the axes clanked merrily
against the stones, the snow was in good condition for
walking, everything seemed favourable, and we gazed
down complacently on the distance already traversed.
Above us the mountain was broken up and easy, and
we climbed on rapidly, each in the fashion that seemed
best to him. So good was our progress at first, that
we were already far up the buttress, and could barely
see our morning’s tracks in the snow beneath, when a
halt was called for breakfast, and we had time to look
around. Now, however unconventional this expedition
may have been in many respects, the sagacious
student of Alpine literature will know that it must be
wholly impossible to omit all reference to the weather.
As soon might one expect two prosaic persons of slight
acquaintanceship to abjure the topic at a chance
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>meeting. The western sky wore a rather ominous
look of half mourning, and heavy grey and black
clouds were whirling about and forming up in close
order in a manner suggestive of rising wind. Even
at this stage of the proceedings the thought crossed
our minds that the storm which was evidently brewing
might possibly overtake us, and that perhaps we ought
at once to turn back.
</p>

<note place="margin">The storm gathers</note>

<p>
One thing was evident; that we must decide
quickly, whatever we did. We determined to push
on for a while, and with that intent girded ourselves
with the rope and worked our way on to the
top of the first buttress. At this point, further
progress directly upwards was impossible, and we
were compelled to cross the gully and make for
the rock on the left-hand side. Considerable care
is always necessary in crossing, horizontally, a gully
filled with snow, where the rope is rather a source
of danger than of security. We had to give all
our attention to the passage, and when we reached
the rocks opposite, the climbing, though not formidable,
was still sufficiently difficult to occupy all our
thoughts for the moment, and we had but little leisure,
and perhaps but little inclination, for meteorological
observations. At the top of the rocks a promising
snow slope, stretching upwards with gentle curves and
sweeps, seemed to offer a fair prospect of rapid progress.
Such snow slopes are at all times a little
<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>deceptive. Even when the climber is close to them they
look oftentimes much easier than they immediately
after prove to be. From a distance, say from under
the verandah of a comfortable hotel, when the climber
<hi rend='italic'>in posse</hi> indicates the way he would pursue with the
end of his cigar, they are absurdly easy. So, too,
are obstacles in the hunting-field, such as stiff hedges
and uncompromising gates, easy enough when the
Nimrod studies them as he whirls along in an express
train. Subsequently, when immediately associated
with a horse, these same obstacles assume a different
guise. Then are the sentiments of the hunter prone
to become modified, and compassion for dumb beasts
becomes more prominent in the <anchor id="corr151"/><corr sic="thoughful">thoughtful</corr> votary of
the chase, till finally it may be observed that the
little wits jump sometimes more than the great ones.
Even so does the mountaineer often discover, on a
nearer acquaintance that the snow incline up which he
proposed to stride merrily is inclined at a highly inconvenient
angle. However, at the commencement of
our slope we found the snow in good condition, and
advanced quickly for some little distance, but before
we had got very far it was necessary to resort to the
axe, and we had then ample opportunities of looking
round. The clouds were lowering more and more,
but as they were swept up by a sou’westerly wind,
the intervening mass of the mountain prevented us
from seeing thoroughly what might be in store for us.
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>The wind, too, was growing stronger every minute,
and my companion, who was still pursuing his argument,
and, as it appeared subsequently, making
some rather good points, had to exert himself considerably
in order to make his voice heard.
</p>

<p>
Presently we halted for a few minutes on some
spiky little rocks, and again looked about. The
weather prospects were just in that doubtful state that
prompts every member of the party to ask the others
what they think. Maurer looked exceedingly vacant and
made no remark. Jaun put a bit of snow in his mouth,
but declined to give an opinion. We, not to be outdone,
assumed very profound expressions, as if prepared to
find ourselves in the right whatever happened, but,
following the example of Lord Burleigh in the famous
tragedy, we said nothing either. At last, some one
suggested that we might go on for a little, and then
see. Accordingly we went on for a little, but then as
a matter of fact the mists swept up around us and
we did not see anything at all. It was, no doubt,
inconvenient that we were unable to penetrate with
our gaze to the regions above, but still we felt that
there was one slight counterbalancing advantage, for
there was present the haunting consciousness that
the gigantic telescope of Chamouni was pointed in
our direction, and at least the enveloping mist ensured
that privacy which is not always accorded to climbers
pursuing their pastime within range of these instruments
of science.
</p>

<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>

<note place="margin"><q>From gay to grave</q></note>

<p>
In the hope that the condition of the upper
snow might be good, and perhaps rather mistaken
in the height we had already reached, we made up
our minds to push on, with the view of reaching
at any rate the top of the ridge before the storm
broke. Every now and again a rent in the clouds
above, lasting for a few seconds, showed us that
the wind was blowing with great force, as thin clouds
of loose snow were swept up and whirled along the
face in curling wreaths. The spectacle might not, at
first sight, have been thought highly diverting: yet
as we pointed upwards to the ridge and watched the
racing snow-drifts driving over the slopes we were
making for, we all laughed very heartily. So universal
is the tendency to be amused at the sight of discomfort
that it even extends to the contemplation of its
occurring shortly to oneself. In the paulo-post-future
the experience is exhilarating: in the actual present
it is less laughter-moving. Laughter in the presence
of events that are, in the true sense of the word,
sensational, comes almost as a reflex action (to borrow
an expression from the physiologists), and the
sympathetic distress that follows takes an appreciable
time to develop. I can recall once being
a witness with some others of a ghastly accident
by which several people were precipitated, together
with a mass of broken timbers and débris of all sorts,
from a great height. A door was burst open and the
ruin met our eyes suddenly. To this day I can
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>remember sounds of laughter at the first view—hysterical
if you like to call it so, and not mirthful, but still
laughter. In a few seconds the realisation of what
had happened came, and then came the distress and
with it expressions of horror, as all worked manfully
to help and rescue the sufferers. The sequence of
emotions was perfectly natural, and only they who
have never passed through such an experience would
speak of inhumanity. There is no want of humanity
in the matter. The suddenness of the impression
begets the train of emotions, and the brain grasps the
facts but slowly. To take another instance: I have
been told by a man whose quickness and presence of
mind were remarkable—a man who as a schoolboy
won a Royal Humane Society’s medal—that on one
occasion he witnessed a friend fall over a staircase
from a great height. The accident was in the highest
degree unexpected: and the witness walked leisurely
on as if nothing had happened. But in a few seconds
came like a severe blow the sudden realisation of what
had taken place. Thought is not always quick. We
can no more exert our minds to their fullest capacity
on a sudden than we can put forth our utmost physical
strength on a sudden. Action when almost instantaneous
is independent of the higher mental faculties,
and is but a reflex. The experience of those who
have been in railway accidents will be of the same
nature. In climbing up a very steep or difficult place
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>if a man falls all are prepared more or less for such
an accident. The whole attention is given to guarding
against a probable contingency, and it follows that the
mind can instantly realise its occurrence. And that
such is the case I have been unlucky enough to
witness, though most fortunately the fall was attended
with no serious consequences. On the same principle,
to take a more trivial example, on difficult rocks
it is the rarest possible accident for a man to sprain
his ankle or knee. The muscles are always prepared
for a possible slip and kept in tension on the alert. On
the loose moraine, when walking leisurely or carelessly,
such an accident is a thousand times more likely to occur.
</p>

<note place="margin">The storm breaks</note>

<p>
Our leader worked away with a will, but the snow got
harder at every step. The growing force of the wind,
which in nautical language had increased from that
vague degree known as a capful to the indefinite
force of a stiff breeze, and the increasing steepness of
the slope, compelled Jaun to make the steps larger
and larger as we ascended. It soon became evident
that the storm would overtake us long before we could
hope to get on to the ridge, and that we had deliberately
walked into something of a trap. The
steps had been cut so far apart that to descend by the
same line would have involved the construction of a
fresh staircase, and on actually turning, we found that
what was a stiff breeze behind us was a half gale when
it met our faces. It was certainly easier to go on
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>than to go back; so we went further and fared much
worse. The slope became steeper, the ice harder,
the half gale became a whole gale, and the delay
between each step seemed interminable. Suddenly,
as we passed from under the lee of a projecting slope
on our right, a tremendous gust of wind, which seemed
to have waited for a few moments in order to collect
its full forces, swept suddenly down and almost tore
us from our foothold. With that a torrent of hail fell,
and for a few moments we had enough to do to hold
on where we stood. Even my companion’s conversation
slackened. He had astutely selected a place in the
caravan immediately behind me, and as the gale was
blowing directly on our backs was enabled to fire off
his remarks and arguments without any possibility of
response. Anything that I said in answer was audible
only to our leader, who took not the smallest
interest in the discussion. Unfortunately, too, it was
difficult to listen with any attention; for as the gusts
came on we were forced to swing all our faces round like
chimney cowls instantly in the same direction. The
squalls became more frequent and more violent, the
thunder and lightning played around merrily, and as
the wind howled by we had to throw ourselves flat
against the slope, adopting the undignified attitudes
of a deer-stalker nearing the brow of a Scotch hill—attitudes
which bring somewhat unduly into prominence
the inadequate nature of the national costume.
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>Fortunately, as has been said, we were screened from
view; and our poses, though possibly ungraceful, were
at any rate uncriticised. The big hailstones, falling
softly around, filled up the steps as they were made,
and our feet were buried up to the ankles in a
moment. In a minute or two the hurricane
passed for the time; then we arose, shook ourselves,
smiled at nothing in particular, and the leader
would find time during the comparative lull to hack
out three or four fresh steps. Certain sounds, not
accounted for by the elements, coming up from below,
may have been suggestions or may have been arguments,
but they were knocked out of all intelligible
shape before they reached the head of the caravan. Not
even the porter at Lloyd’s or the captain of a merchantman
could have made himself audible in that cyclone.
Upwards we went, fighting for each step and for each
yard gained as hard as if we were storming a fortress.
Even while the leader had his axe in the air ready to
deliver a fresh blow a distant roar would betoken
another onslaught, and we instantly fell flat down like
tin soldiers struck with the well-directed pea, and disposed
ourselves at a convenient angle of resistance;
and so we went on, when we did go on at all. If the
relation is wearisome it is also realistic, for we found
that the actual experience was far from being lively;
but all things must have an end, including even the
<hi rend='italic'>feuilleton</hi> in a Parisian newspaper or the walk up to
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>the Bel Alp on a hot day, and the termination came
almost unexpectedly.
</p>

<note place="margin">A battle with the elements</note>

<p>
We had got thoroughly tired of perpetually clinging
on by the simple force of adhesion to the storm-swept
slope, and felt almost inclined to give up the struggle
against the elements and to go straight on trusting to
chance. Maurer, below, wore the expression of frowning
discontent best seen in amateur tenors singing a
tender love ditty. Jaun had remarked half-a-dozen
times that the very next squall would infallibly sweep
us all away, and his cheerful prophetic utterances
really seemed on the point of being fulfilled, when,
almost suddenly, the snow seemed to vanish from
under our feet, and we found ourselves on the summit
of the ridge; at least directly above us no more ascent
appeared to present. It was difficult to realise adequately
the exact direction in which we were facing,
but I suppose that as the ridge runs about north and
south by the compass, we were facing a little south of
east. This was an important matter to decide, as the
mist was gathered thick around and the idea of descent
had to be at once considered now that we had got to
a position of some degree of definiteness. At our feet
the snow slope fell away in a manner so distinct that
we were without doubt really on the top of some portion
of the ridge. The difficulty was to estimate how
far to our right the summit of the Aiguille du Midi
itself lay. However, we felt with relief the truth of
<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>somebody’s remark that we had at length succeeded
in getting somewhere; so far, no doubt, matters were
satisfactory. Howbeit, our pleasure was somewhat
modified by the discovery that the gale blew with considerably
more force on the south-east side than it did
on the one by which we had ascended. We looked
towards the south and endeavoured to gather our wits
together to elucidate the geographical problem that
presented. At the foot of the slope must lie the
upper basin of the Vallée Blanche and the Glacier de
Tacul; unfortunately there seemed to be a prodigious
storm going on in that basin, and clouds of loose
snow were whirling about in all directions. It was
impossible to understand these winds; one might
have thought that Æolus had just stepped out to
attend a committee meeting of the gods, and that all
his subordinates were having high jinks during his
absence.

The possibility of actually completing the ascent
of the mountain seemed out of the question, and
the hope that we might have crept under the
shelter of the ridge to the final little rock cone of
the Aiguille was literally thrown to the winds. Here
again, therefore, this narrative is highly unconventional,
for it is impossible to consult M. Roget’s
<q>Thesaurus</q> and indulge with its aid in any grandiloquent
description of the view from the summit,
although my account has now reached the stage at
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>which such word painting ought properly to be inserted.
We turned to our right, the direction in
which the peak lay, and walked some little way along
the ridge till we got under shelter of a rock; now we
were able once more to stand upright and, huddled
together, took the opportunity which had been denied
to us for some hours to interchange views. All agreed
that the situation was vile; that word, at least, may be
taken as the resultant of the various forcible epithets
actually employed. All agreed that the cold was
intense, the prospect doubtful, and the panorama <hi rend='italic'>nil</hi>.
There was but one redeeming feature: extreme discomfort
will reveal humour in those in whom that
quality would not be expected <hi rend='italic'>a priori</hi> to find a dwelling-place,
and to each one of us the spectacle of his
three wobegone companions seemed to afford, if not
amusement, at least an inkling of complacency.
Maurer removed the pack from his shoulders, and it
was then perceived that our cup of misery was full,
and our sole remaining bottle of wine completely
empty. We had originally started with two, one white
and one red, of an inferior and indigestible quality,
but had left the white wine down below on the snow;
we had previously drunk it. The other bottle had
broken against some projecting rock in climbing up,
and the resulting leakage had led to the formation of
a very large circular red patch in the small of Maurer’s
back, wherever that anatomical region might be
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>situated in our squat and sturdy little guide. After
muttering together in patois for a little while the
guides seized their axes and suddenly commenced with
great vigour to hack out a large hole in the ice. We
fell to also, and for some few minutes all worked away
with the best of good will; the splinters and little
blocks of ice flew around under our blows, and before
long we had excavated a flat basin capable of holding
water. At the least, the exercise had the effect of
warming us, and Maurer, who previously, from the
effects of the cold, had been the colour of a congested
alderman in the face, gradually assumed a more
healthy hue. We now inquired what the object might
be of preparing this cavern. Thereupon Jaun gave vent
to the ingenious suggestion that we had better remain
where we were and sleep in it. The idea seemed too
likely to lead to permanent repose to be commendable,
and we received his proposition, as befitted its nature,
with some coolness, remarking that on the whole we
should prefer to go home. This view led to further
conversation; ultimately we descended a few feet on
the south-east side and then made our way along the
face of the slope in a south-westerly direction towards
the hut on the Aiguille du Midi. The snow was soft,
and we went on for some distance without difficulty,
till we again reached the ridge on the south-west side of
the Aiguille, having thus passed round the base of
the final peak of the mountain, which consists of a
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>comparatively small rocky cone jutting up from the main
ridge. We were still of course a long way from the hut,
but as in this situation we were much more sheltered, we
took the opportunity to review the state of affairs and
to consider our position, which for the moment, like
that of the pocket of a lady’s ball dress, was indeterminate.
What were we to do? As with the diners
at <q>Prix fixe</q> restaurant, there were three courses for
us: we might go down on one side, we might descend
on the other side, or we might remain where we were.
The latter alternative was as distasteful now as it had
been just previously, and it was negatived decisively.
<q>Very good,</q> said the guides; <q>if you won’t stay here
we must go down that way,</q> and they pointed in a
direction westerly by the compass. My companion
and I were opposed to this plan for two reasons: one
that the route would, if it led anywhere in particular,
take us down to the Glacier des Bossons, where we did
not want to go, the other that by reason of the
marvellous fury of the hurricane it would have been
altogether impossible to follow at all the line indicated.
We were only in fact able to dart out from under
shelter of the rock and peer down into the misty
depths for a few seconds at a time, for the gale took
our breath away as completely as in the <q>cavern of
the winds</q> at Niagara. To have climbed down a new
and difficult rock cliff in the face of the numbing cold
would have been little short of suicidal.

<note place="margin">Descent down Vallée Blanche</note>

<p>
It is Artemus Ward, I think, who describes the
ingenious manner in which Baron Trenck, of prison-breaking
fame, escaped on one occasion from durance
vile. For fifteen long years the Baron had lain
immured, and had tried in vain to carry out all the
sensational methods of escape ever suggesting themselves
to his fertile brain. At last an idea occurred to
him. He opened the door and walked out. By an
intellectual effort of almost equal brilliancy and
originality we solved the difficulty that beset us: we
turned towards the south-east and walked quietly
down the slope for a hundred feet or so. Simplicity
of thought is characteristic of great minds. Why,
nevertheless, it had not occurred to us before to escape
by this line I can no more explain than I can give the
reason why all the ladies in a concert-room smile, as
one woman, when a singer of their own sex makes her
appearance on the platform, or why itinerant harp
players always wear tall hats. Immediately the complexion
of affairs brightened up. The wind was much
less furious than it had been on the ridge, and the hail
was replaced by snow. Jaun now gave it as his
opinion that the best line of descent would consist in
crossing round the head of the Vallée Blanche and
the upper slopes of the Glacier du Géant, so as to join
the ordinary route leading from the Col du Géant to
the Montanvert. But in the thick mist it would have
been far from easy to hit off the right track, and we
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>thought it possible to make a short cut to the same
end, and to find a way directly down the Vallée
Blanche towards the rocks known as the Petit
Rognon. We had no compass with us, but the direction
of the slope indicated the proper line of descent
to follow. In most years it would not be easy to
discover the way through the complicated crevasses of
the ice-fall situated between the <q>Rognon</q> and the
easterly rocks of the Aiguille du Midi; but in 18— so
much snow had fallen early in the spring and so little
had melted during the summer, that we experienced
comparatively little difficulty in descending almost in
a straight line. During this part of the expedition
the good qualities of our guides showed once more to
advantage. Unquestionably while on the ridge they
had put forward suggestions which were rather wild
in character, and which were proved now to be mistaken.
The intense cold and the beating of the storm
seemed rather to have paralysed their usually calm
judgment, and it is an odd fact that guides, even when
first rate, are oftentimes more affected by such conditions
than are the amateurs whom they conduct.
We could no more, with such experience as we
possessed, have led the way aright as our leader did
with unerring sagacity, than an untutored person
could write out a full orchestra score. We could only
insist on a given line being taken if in their judgment
it were possible. Once fairly started, we felt that we
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>must push our plan through, employing the same
form of argument as the man did in support of a
bold statement that a certain beaver, closely pursued
by a dog, had climbed up a tree. It was not a
question now whether we could do it, or could not do
it; we had to do it. The day was far spent, there
was possibly much difficult work before us, and the
exertion already undergone had been tolerably severe.
The temptation was therefore great rather to scamp the
work of finding the best and safest track through the
ice-fall, but our leader displayed as much care and
thoroughness as if he were strolling over snow slopes
with a critical Chamouni guide behind him. A
momentary glimpse of the familiar form of the
Aiguille du Géant right in front of us confirmed the
judgment that we were on the right track. In
descending the ice-fall we passed to the right of the
Petit Rognon, and at the base of the Séracs halted and
thought we would have something to eat. Maurer produced
our stock of provisions, which consisted of one
roll studded with little bits of broken glass and reduced
by the action of wine and water to the consistence
of a poultice. The refection was, therefore, as unsatisfactory
as a meal out of a loosely tied nosebag to a
cab horse. And now for another departure from time-honoured
custom. All mountain narratives at this
period of the day make reference to the use of tobacco,
the well-earned pipe, and so forth. But the sleety rain,
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>which for the last hour and a half had replaced the
snow, had soaked everything so thoroughly that an
attempt to carry out the orthodox proceeding did not,
like most failures, end in smoke. So we trudged on
again empty and unsolaced.

<note place="margin">A scanty repast</note>

<p>
As the shades of night were falling, four dripping and
woe-begone travellers might, to borrow the novelist’s
common mode of expression, have been observed
toiling up the steep path towards the old Montanvert
hotel—that is, they might have been observed by anybody
who was foolish enough to be out of doors on
such a detestable evening. We entered the familiar
little room, an ingenious compound of a toyshop and
a barrack, and notwithstanding that we were viewed
with marked disfavour by the other guests therein
assembled in consequence of our moist and steamy
condition, we seated ourselves and called for refreshment.
The atmosphere in the stuffy den called the
salon was a trifle pungent, and having contributed a
little additional dampness to the apartment we set off
again. That familiar old room with its odd collection
of curiosities, in which the fare was on the whole
more disproportionate to the price than at any
other institution of a similar kind in the mountains,
has ceased to exist long ago. I fancy that it did not
require much pulling down. It is happily replaced
now by one of the best managed and most comfortable
mountain hotels to be found in the Alps, a sure sign
<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>of which attraction is to be found in the fact that it is,
at any rate, spoken of with disfavour by the inhabitants
of the village below or by such as do not hold shares.
Another hour’s descent and we passed through the few
scattered houses just outside Chamouni. The attractions
on the way down had not diverted us from our stern
purpose of reaching Couttet’s hotel as soon as possible.
We had politely declined the invitation of a perennially
knitting young woman to view a live chamois. The
spasmodic smile called up by each approaching tourist
faded from her countenance as we passed by. Four
times did we decline the gentle refreshment of <hi rend='italic'>limonade
gazeuse</hi>, once did we sternly refuse to partake
of strawberries, and twice to purchase crystals. It
was dark as we neared the town; it may have been my
fancy, but I cannot help thinking that I perceived our
old friend the blind beggar with the lugubrious expression
which he wore when on duty, and with the tall
hat which served the purpose of an alms’-box, and
which he did not wear when on duty, enjoying himself
in a very merry manner by the side of a blazing fire.
Notwithstanding that night had fallen there was still
a little group by the bridge round the one-armed telescope
man, anxiously crowding to hear the last news
of the two insane Englishmen who had without doubt
perished that day miserably on the rocks of the Midi.
A project had already been started to organise an expedition
on the morrow to search for the bodies; and
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>we might very possibly, if we had cared for the excitement,
have been allowed to join the party.
</p>

<note place="margin">A projected expedition</note>

<p>
As in a play the most striking situation is by
the discreet author reserved to the conclusion, so in
this contradictory chapter the most glaring deficiency
comes now at the end. My readers, if they have
generously followed me so far, will recognise that we
not only went on something of a fool’s errand,
incurring considerable difficulty and perhaps risk in
that mission, but that we never got up the mountain
at all. The force of contradictoriness can no
further go. Still, it may be pointed out that we did
actually accomplish all that was novel in the expedition.
Once on the ridge, the remaining portion
of the climb is, in fine weather, easy and well known,
so the fact that the Aiguille du Midi can be ascended
by this line by any one consumed with an ambition to
do so, is beyond doubt. We were not probably at one
point more than twenty minutes or half an hour from
the actual summit. I cannot honestly advise anybody
to follow our tracks; but in all probability, if someone
should desire to do so, he need not, under favourable
conditions, contemplate meeting with any unsurmountable
difficulties.

<p>
It is to some extent an unfortunate circumstance that
in a personal narrative of adventure the result is
practically known from the very beginning. The only
uncertainty that can exist is the actual pattern on
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>which the links of the chain are united together, for
the climax is from the outset a foregone conclusion.
The descriptive account will inevitably conduct the
reader along a more or less mazy path to an assured
goal. There is certainly one other variety, but that
takes the less satisfactory form of an obituary notice.
Even in a thoroughly well-acted play a perceptible
shudder runs through the audience when two actors
select each a chair, draw them down to the footlights,
and one announces <q>’Tis now some fourteen years
ago.</q> The expression in its pristine dramatic simplicity
may still be heard in transpontine theatres,
but modern realism insists usually on a paraphrase.
The audience cannot but feel, however thrilling the
story to be told, that at any rate the two players have
survived the adventures they have to narrate, and on
the whole a good many wish they hadn’t. There sit
the heroes, and exert themselves as they will their
recital is apt to fall somewhat flat. In like manner I
will not attempt to conceal the fact that the ultimate
result of our numerous attempts on the peak which
forms the subject of this chapter was that we got up it,
and the fact may also be divulged that we came down
again, and in safety. Indeed, it seems difficult now to
realise the length of time during which our ultimate
success oscillated in the balance—at one time appearing
hopeless, at another problematical, at times almost
certain, and then again apparently out of our reach.

<note place="margin">Expeditions on the Aig. du Dru</note>

<p>
In 1874, with two guides, of whom Alexander
Burgener was one, we started for the Montanvert
with the intention of making for the ridge between the
Aiguille du Dru and the Aiguille Verte, with the object
of further investigating the route which Messrs.
Pendlebury, Kennedy and Marshall had essayed on an
occasion already described, when the bad condition
of the rocks frustrated their hopes. The mountain
was probably in a very different state on this occasion,
and we experienced no very great difficulty in discovering
a fairly easy route up the rocks. The chief
trouble consisted in the fact that the rock gully by
which the ascent is chiefly made was extensively plastered
over with ice, a condition in which we nearly
always found it. The last part of the climb up to
the ridge affords a most splendid scramble. The face
is so steep on either side that the climber comes quite
suddenly to a position whence he overlooks the
northern slope, if slope it may be called, and looks
down on to the Glacier du Nant Blanc. Seen in grey
shadow, or half shrouded in shifting mists and coloured
only with half-tints, the precipice is magnificent; huge
sheets of clear ice coat its flanks, and the almost unbroken
descent of rock affords as striking a spectacle
as the mountaineer fond of wild desolation can well
picture.
</p>

<lg>
<l>If you would see this slope aright,</l>
<l>Look at it by the pale grey light.</l>
</lg>

<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>

<p>
On the left the mass of the Aiguille du Dru cuts
off the view of the fertile regions; far away on the right
the huge tapering towers of rock form a massive foreground
stretching away to the base of the Aiguille
Verte. The spectator too seems strangely shut off,
so that, gazing around, on either side he can see
but a narrow extent of the mountain. We looked
down and did not like what we saw; we looked up and
liked it less. The day was fine and the mountain in
good condition. I can recall now that our eyes must
have wandered over the very route that ultimately
proved to be the right one, and yet to none of us that
afternoon did it appear in the least degree possible.
Unquestionably the crags of the Aiguille du Dru looked
formidable enough from this point of view, and we
could not but think that nature must have provided
some easier mode of access to the summit than this
face seemed to afford. We climbed along the ridge till
we were almost against the face of the mountain, but
then we had to turn our gaze so directly upwards that
matters looked still worse. Then we faced about and
climbed in the other direction. The rocks seemed to
grow bigger and bigger the more we looked at them.
What the guides actually thought I do not quite know,
but at the moment my own impression was that it
would be impossible to ascend more than two or three
hundred feet: so we turned and came back. Even
while we yet descended the thought came that this
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>face of the mountain was perhaps not so utterly hopeless
as it had appeared a few minutes previously, and
in my own mind I decided that, should we fail in discovering
some much more promising line from another
point of view, we would at least return to the ridge
often enough to familiarise ourselves with this aspect
of the mountain, with the idea that such familiarity
if it did not succeed in breeding contempt might at
least give birth to a more sanguine frame of mind.
The farther we got from our point of view the more
hopeful did the mental impression seem to become,
and by the time we reached Chamouni we had all
separately arrived at the conclusion—somewhat
selfish perhaps, but justifiable under the circumstances—that
if asked what we thought of the
possibility of ascending by the face we had tried, we
would give honestly the opinion we had formed while
on the ridge, and not the opinion at which we had
arrived subsequently.
</p>

<note place="margin">Other climbers attack the peak</note>

<p>
Other explorers were meanwhile at work on the
mountain, but so far as I could learn all their
attempts were made on the south-western peak. At
any rate they followed more or less the line we had
first struck out. Some thought that the lower peak
alone was feasible, others that the higher peak was
attainable only from the south-western side. So
thought Mr. E. R. Whitwell; so again, Mr. J. Birkbeck,
jun., both of whom reached probably a much
<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>higher point on the south-western face than we succeeded
in obtaining in 1873.
</p>

<p>
In 1875 we were making our way once more by
the Col de Balme to Chamouni, and being in somewhat
of a reflective mood, induced by the consumption of a
soup-tureen full of bread and milk at the hotel at the top
of the pass, we sought a shady spot hard by whence a
good view of the Aiguille du Dru could be obtained, and
contemplated the precipices as seen from this point of
view. The northern slope leading up to the ridge over
which we had looked lay well before us. The upper
part of the mountain looked distinctly different as far
as accessibility was concerned. It seemed just possible,
if a way could only be found up from the level of
the ridge to a certain ledge some distance above, that
the final mass might be feasible. There appeared
to be a sort of gully sloping upwards in a direction
curved away from us, in which the snow lay so thick
that the rocks on either side could not, we thought,
be very steep. At the least it seemed to be worth
our while to make for this gully, which was obviously
unattainable from the ridge itself, for it was here cut
off by a belt of straight rock.
</p>

<note place="margin">We try the northern side</note>

<p>
A few days later we carried the idea into effect. It
was necessary to engage some one to carry the tent,
and Burgener was deputed to search for a porter of a
willing disposition and suitable physical conformation.
Presently he came back in company with a shambling
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>youth of great length of limb and somewhat lanky
frame. We inquired if he were willing to come with
us, whereupon the young man was seized with violent
facial contortions, and we perceived that he suffered
from an impediment in his speech. Not wishing to
render him nervous by our presence, we took a short
turn in the garden, leaving him where he stood. On
our return the young man’s efforts culminated in the
remark, <q>How much?</q> We said, <q>Twenty-five francs,</q>
and then started off to consult the barometer. On
coming back after this interval we found that the
young man had just previously succeeded in articulating
<q>Yes.</q> The practical result of this one-sided
colloquy was that the next day the tall young man
was laden with the tent, with directions to carry it
up to a point immediately opposite the Montanvert
below the Glacier du Nant Blanc. The tall young
man shouldered his burden and started off with
great activity. We followed him somewhat later
under the rather transparent pretence of going to
hunt for crystals next day. Making our way up by
a long ridge lying between the Glacier du Nant
Blanc and a little snow patch dignified in some maps
by the appellation of the Glacier du Dru, we skirted
round the base of the Aiguille looking constantly
upwards to find some practicable line of ascent, and
hoping that we might discover one which would conduct
us up on to the main mass of the mountain
<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>before we had got opposite to the point by which we
had made our ascent from the southern side. It soon
became evident that we were very unlikely to find
a way. Far above jutted out a little horizontal table
of rock. Burgener observed that if we could only get
there it would be something. So far his remarks did
not appear inaccurate, but it was perfectly clear before
long that there was no chance of getting any higher,
supposing we could get on to this platform; yet a
little further, and we perceived that we could not even
get to it. Ultimately we discovered that the platform
itself was an optical delusion. It did not seem worth
while to make any attempt to reach the summit of
the ridge from the side we were on, even if we could
have done so, which I doubt. The day may come
when the climber will seek to discover some variation
to the route up the peak; but mountaineering skill
will indeed have improved out of all knowledge if
anyone ever succeeds in getting up this northern face.
From every point of view we surveyed it, and from every
point of view, in our opinion, it was equally impossible.
So in the evening we came back once more
to the tent, from the door of which protruded a pair
of thick boots. These encased the feet articulated to
the lanky legs of the tall young man, who had been
enjoying a siesta of some ten or twelve hours’ duration.
Kicking gently at a prominent bulging of the
canvas on the opposite side to the door had the
<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>effect of waking our slumbrous friend, who was exceedingly
sarcastic at our want of success; so, at
least, we judged by his expression of countenance.
For a long while his efforts yielded no verbal result.
But his words seemed as it were to stick fast in an
endeavour to bring them out three or four abreast
through a portal that was capable only of allowing
egress to them in single file. Of a sudden the jostling
syllables broke down the obstructing barrier, and he
startled us by pouring forth a string of remarks with
precipitate volubility. Knowing, however, that it
would be some time before we could hope to try the
peak again, we were not loth to leave him under the
impression, to be communicated to his friends at
Chamouni, that we had come to the conclusion that
the mountain was inaccessible.
</p>

<note place="margin">The mountain fever recurs</note>

<p>
It was not till 1878 that we were able to revisit
once more the scene of our many failures.
</p>

<p>
During the winter months, however, the thought
of the stubborn Aiguille had been from time to time
discussed, and when J. Oakley Maund and I came
back to Chamouni we had very serious intentions.
This time we were both possessed with one fixed determination
with regard to the Aiguille. Either we
would get up to the top or, at the worst, would, as far
as lay in our power, prove that it was inaccessible by
any line of attack. By my wish, our first attempts
were to be made by the old route leading towards the
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>lower peak; not that we were very sanguine of succeeding
by this line of ascent, but rather because we
felt that no very great amount of exploration would
be necessary to determine whether the higher point
could or could not be reached from this side; but
though our intentions were good we were scarcely
prepared for the difficulties that met us from the
beginning. The elements seemed to have set their
faces against us. Time after time when all was
ready for a start we were baulked by snow, wind, or
rain. Day after day we sat waiting in vain for the
favourable moment, sometimes at our bivouac high
up above the Mer de Glace, by the side of the Glacier
de la Charpoua, till hope deferred and a series
of <hi rend='italic'>table d’hôte</hi> dinners combined with want of
exercise to make the heart sick and the individual
despondently dyspeptic. Perhaps the wind would
shift round a point or two towards the north and a
couple of fine days occur. Straightway we set off for
the tent which we left concealed at the bivouac.
Then came the rain again, and we had to return
soaked and dejected. Sometimes it rained before
we got to the Montanvert and sometimes after, and in
fact we seemed to be making perpetually fitful excursions
from the kitchen fire at the Montanvert to that
at Couttet’s hotel. On hydropathic principles we
found the state of the elements no mean form of cure
for the mountain fever. Still, like the hungry butler,
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>we reflected that everything comes to him who waits,
and seizing every possible opportunity did manage to
achieve some climbing during the rare intervals of
moderately favourable weather.

<note place="margin">The campaign opens</note>

<p>
The campaign was opened with an attempt made
with Jaun and Andreas Maurer as guides. A youth
of hollow visage and weak joints (a relation, possibly,
of our friend with the one defective articulation), who
did not much enter into the spirit of the expedition,
and who seemed by his expression to echo Hamlet’s
interrogation as to the necessity of bearing fardels,
carried our tent up to the grass slopes by the
Charpoua glacier. Here, on a smooth, level patch
of turf surrounded on three sides by rocks, we established
a little country seat, though we scarcely realised
on this first occasion how often it would be our lot
to run up and spend the night there, and to return
to town the following morning. There are many
and excellent camping places about these slopes; dry
dwarf rhododendron bushes abound, and water is
plentiful. There was no difficulty in rising early the
next morning, for at some time in the small hours the
spindle-legged porter was seized with terrible cramp.
Under ordinary circumstances his lower limbs were
imperfectly under his control, and when thus affected
they became perfectly ungovernable, so that the
neat order in which we had disposed ourselves overnight
for slumber was rudely disarranged, and we
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>were forced to rise and turn out till the spasms
should have subsided. Under the influence of gentle
friction the spasms quieted down, and when we left
he was troubled only with a few twitching kicks, such
as may be observed in a dreaming dog. At 2 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi>
we started and wended our way up the glacier, every
step of which seemed familiar. To our surprise
and delight the snow was in first-rate order, and
our spirits rose at the prospect of a good climb;
but the time had not yet come for success, and our
hopes were soon to be dashed. There was still an
immense amount of snow on the lower rock slopes
over which access to the south-western peak is alone
possible, and this snow was in a highly treacherous
condition. Before we had ascended many feet the
guides very properly refused to go on, a determination
with which we felt ourselves bound to acquiesce.
They pointed out that it would be unwarrantably
dangerous to descend late in the afternoon over deep
snow, soft, and but loosely adhering to the rocks.
Under such conditions it is of course impossible to
judge of the foothold, and there is nothing to hold on
to with the hands. There was no other alternative,
therefore, if we were to follow this route, than to wait
till more of the snow should have melted, or else to
find a track where the rocks were bare. As far as we
could ascertain, however, there was no such track to
be seen. We decided to go back, but still remained at
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>Chamouni, for we durst not lose a single favourable
opportunity. With an imperturbability bred of long
experience did we meet the sniggers and sneers of
certain croakers below, who looked with an unfavourable
eye on our proceedings.
</p>

<note place="margin">A new leader</note>

<p>
Within the next fortnight we made two further
attempts by much the same route and with the same
guides, but only succeeded in going far enough to
prove that the opinion of the guides was perfectly
correct with regard to the state of the snow. Already
matters seemed to justify some gloomy doubt as to
whether we could carry out even the exploratory
part of our programme, for Jaun was compelled to
leave us in order to fulfil another engagement, and
we scarcely knew where to turn to find another man
capable of guiding us in the way we desired to go.
Still our determination was unshaken by our run of
ill-luck. We would not give it up. With no more
definite object than that of justifying an impending
<hi rend='italic'>table d’hôte</hi> dinner, I was walking up the Montanvert
path one rainy afternoon, when a ray of sunlight
suddenly burst upon me in the person of Alexander
Burgener. He had come over the Col du Géant with
a party of travellers, and to our delight was not only
disengaged, but exceedingly anxious to attack once
more, or, in fact, as often as we liked, the obstinate
Aiguille. From the moment that he assumed the
chief command matters began to wear a different
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>complexion, for we learnt that he had taken every
opportunity to consider and study the mountain. By
his advice a complete change of tactics was adopted.
We decided to abandon all idea of attacking the
lower peak, and made up our minds to try the higher
summit by the route we had first followed four years
previously. We had often discussed together our
chances of success on this peak, and had often come
to the conclusion that its ascent was more than
doubtful. But now Burgener was so positive of ultimate
triumph, and so confident in his own powers,
not only of getting up himself, but of getting us also
to our goal, that the whole matter seemed placed
before us in a different light. We might have to
wait, we might have to try many times, but still we
could not but believe the impression that now gradually
formed that we must ultimately succeed. To
the spirit which Burgener displayed that year, and
which he imbued in us (at a time when it must be
confessed that such a spirit was much wanted, for
we were as downcast as water-cure patients during
the process), and to his sagacity and great guiding
qualities, the whole of our ultimate success was due.
I knew that, as a guide, he was immeasurably superior
to an amateur in his trained knack of finding the
way, and that in quickness on rocks the two could
hardly be compared. But previously it had always
seemed to me that the amateur excelled in one great
<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>requisite, viz., pluck. Let this record show that in
one instance at least this estimate was erroneous, for
had it not been for Burgener’s indomitable pluck we
should never have succeeded in climbing the Aiguille
du Dru.
</p>

<note place="margin">Our sixteenth attempt</note>

<p>
Burgener was of opinion that from the summit of
the actual ridge lying east of the higher peak, and
between it and the Aiguille Verte, it was not feasible
to ascend on to the face of the mountain, and he
proposed accordingly that we should commence by
making a study of the rocks lying to the left of the
main gully running up to this same ridge, endeavouring
if possible to discover some point where we could
bear off to the left on to the real mass of the mountain.
In addition he pointed out that the upper rocks
might be very difficult and require much time (as we
had already agreed together in previous years that
they were altogether impossible, this remark seemed
probable enough), and it was important therefore to
discover the easiest and quickest way up the lower part
of the rock slopes. Accordingly we departed—and
this was our sixteenth attempt—from the Montanvert
one morning at 1 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> We had long since cultivated
a manner of going about our business in such a way
as to avoid the gaze of the curious, and set forth on
this occasion in much the same spirit that burglars
adopt when on evil errands intent. The day was entirely
spent as agreed in studying the lower rocks and
<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>working out accurately the most feasible line of assault.
But though we ascended on this occasion to no very
great height we were perpetually engaged in climbing,
and the quantity of snow which still lay on the rocks
rendered progress difficult and care necessary. Still
it was no haphazard exploration that we were engaged
in, and the spirit of deliberation in which we
began begat a spirit of hopefulness as we went on.
A fancied insufficiency of guiding strength, coupled
with a decidedly insufficient supply of rope and an
inherent idea that the new line of assault contemplated
was not to be worked out to an end at the first
attempt, all combined to drive us back to Chamouni
late the same evening.
</p>

<note place="margin">Sports and pastimes</note>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Après cela le déluge</hi>, and for a long time high mountaineering
of any description was out of the question.
Desperate were the attempts we made to amuse ourselves,
and to while away the time. Sports and
pastimes within the limited area of the hotel premises
were the fashion for a time. The courtyard in front of
Couttet’s hotel was made into a lawn-tennis ground.
The village stores being ransacked yielded a limited
supply of parti-coloured india-rubber balls; the village
carpenter constructed bats out of flat pieces of wood,
and we sought to forget the unpropitious elements by
playing morning, noon, and night. As a result several
windows and a lamp were reduced to ruin. Then we
went a-crayfishing. A basket carriage, which was
con<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>structed apparently of iron sheeting, but painted over
with a wicker-work pattern in order to deceive a flea-bitten
grey steed of great age with the impression that
it was very light, conveyed us to Châtelard, which by a
twofold inaccuracy was termed the fishing-ground, our
object being to catch animals which were not fish and
lived in water. There the sport began, and was conducted
on this wise. Sticks with a cleft at the end,
into which nondescript pieces of ill-smelling meat
were wedged, were submerged in a little brook to tempt
the prey, but the only bites we got were from the
horse-flies and inflicted on our own persons; howbeit,
one or two of the party when at a distance from their
fellow-sportsmen averred that they had been on a
point of catching monsters of the deep the size of
lobsters. We did not discover till subsequently that,
led astray by a plausible peasant possessed of riparian
rights and untruthful propensities, we had been fishing
(or <q>crustaceaning,</q> to speak correctly) all day in a
stream untenanted by any crayfish whatever, the
result being that we caught a chill and nothing else.
The ancient steed, moreover, though he bowled along
merrily enough down the hill to Châtelard and required
no more stimulus than an occasional chirrup
from the driver afforded, was yet very loth to draw
the party back up the hill at the same pace, and
required such constant stimulation of a more active
kind on the way back that it was found necessary
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>before we reached the village to stop and smooth out
the creases on his sides. The next day the report
came that the spotted grey was <q>très malade,</q> and the
next day too my right arm was excessively stiff.
</p>

<p>
A subsequent sporting expedition yielded happier
results. One of the party, gifted with diplomatic talents
and a power of detecting the vulnerable points in the
character of the natives, purchased, for the sum of
one franc, information from a shockheaded juvenile
suffering from a skin eruption as to the best stocked
streams. Then did the deep yield up its carnivorous
denizens. Artfully and in silence did the anglers wait
for their prey to claw the reeking bait. Deftly and
warily did they withdraw the rod, sometimes with two
or three victims clinging in a bunch, and land the spoil
on the bank. Then would the crayfish loosen their
hold, roll over on their backs, flap their tails very
briskly, and start off with amazing rapidity for short
country walks, speedily to be captured and consigned
to the recesses of a receptacle, bearing a suspicious resemblance
to Madame Couttet’s work-basket. Ultimately
they formed the basis of a <q>bisque</q> not unworthy
of Brébant.
</p>

<note place="margin">Apparel oft proclaims the man</note>

<p>
What time the india-rubber balls were all burst
and the fishing-ground had lost its attraction, seated
on a tilted chair beneath the verandah we fell a-musing
and studied human nature, and the various types that
presented day after day round and about the hotel.
<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>Much was there to marvel at in many of the costumes,
to many of which the late Mr. Planché himself would
have been unable to assign a date. It has been
noticed of course, times out of mind, as a characteristic
of the Briton, that a costume in which he would not
go coal-heaving at home is considered good enough
for Sunday in the Alps. One gentleman indeed,
whose own apparel would have been considered untidy
even if he had been a member of a shipwrecked crew,
had been enlarging on this topic with much fervour,
to a select audience, dwelling especially on the discourtesy
thus shown to the natives of the country. I
looked, when Sunday came, that he should be clad in
raiment of more than ordinary fitness and splendour,
but the only changes that I could perceive from the
week-day vesture consisted in a tall hat, which somebody
had mistaken for an opera hat on some occasion,
and a long strip of rag wound round a cut finger,
while his wife, who had recently been on the glaciers,
appeared in a low cut dress, so that she presented a
curious piebald appearance. The lateness of the season
may have accounted for the fact that many of the garments
seemed rapidly to be resolving into their pristine
condition of warp and woof, especially about the region
where it is usual in the Alps to light the poison-darting
lucifer matches of the country. There were flannel
shirts with collars on some, and flannel shirts without
them on others, while yet a third set wore white
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>chokers round their necks made of vulcanite, so that
they looked like favourite pug-dogs, or fashioned of a
shiny paper, which obviously had no more to do with
the garment with which they were temporarily associated
than the label of an expensive wine at a second-rate
restaurant has to do with the contents of the bottle.
Then we fell to anatomical study, and marvelled at
the various imperfections of development the muscle
known to the learned as the gastrocnemius<note place="foot">Described in anatomical text-books as forming the swelling of
the calf.</note> could
exhibit in the legs of our countrymen, and wondered
why they took such pains in their costume to display
its usually unsymmetrical proportions, and wondered
too if they really believed that a double folding back
of the upper part of the stocking below the knickerbocker
deceived anyone with an appearance of mighty
thews. Then we went off and tapped the barometer,
which was as devoid of principle as a bone setter, and
kept on persistently rising. We made friends with
a little stray waif of a dog of obsequious demeanour
and cringing disposition, prone to roll over on its
back when spoken to, thereby displaying a curiously
speckled stomach, but which was withal inclined to be
amiable, and wagged its tail so vigorously on being
noticed that I quite feared it might sustain a sprain
at the root of that appendage. But our friendship
was short-lived. Before long our little friend found
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>an acquaintance in the shape of a small semi-shaved
mongrel with a tail like a stalk of asparagus run
to seed. After a little preliminary walking about on
tiptoe, friendly overtures were made. The game
commenced by the playmates licking each others’
noses; next they ran round with surprising rapidity
in very small circles, and then fell to wrestling in the
middle of the courtyard. These canine acquaintanceships
always end in the same way. Before long a
sudden, sharp squeak was heard, and the last I saw of
my little friend was a vanishing form darting round
the nearest corner, with his tail as much between his
legs as the excessive shortness of that excrescence
would permit. His playmate, somewhat disturbed
for a moment by this abrupt termination of the
acquaintanceship, gazed pensively, with ears erect,
for a while in the direction in which his friend had
vanished: then investigated two or three unimportant
objects by the sense of smell, consumed a few blades
of grass, yawned twice, stretched himself once, rolled
on something which had puzzled him, and retired
to repose at a little distance to await the expected
medicinal effects of the herb of which he had partaken.
</p>

<note place="margin">A canine acquaintance</note>

<p>
This is a true saying, that <q>There’s small choice
in rotten apples,</q> and a description of boredom in one
place is much like the same in another. Gradually,
weariness of the flesh below in the valley became
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>almost intolerable, while we were longing for an
opportunity to weary the flesh, in another way, on the
mountain. Ultimately, to my infinite regret, Maund
found himself obliged to depart to fulfil an engagement
elsewhere, but I still held on, though the conviction
was daily becoming stronger that the rain
would go on till the winter snows came.
</p>

<note place="margin">Turning point of the expedition</note>

<p>
On a mountain such as we knew the Aiguille du
Dru to be it would not have been wise to make any
attempt with a party of more than four. No doubt
three—that is, an amateur with two guides—would
have been better still, but I had, during the enforced
inaction through which we had been passing, become
so convinced of ultimate success that I was anxious
to find a companion to share it. Fortunately,
J. Walker Hartley, a highly skilful and practised
mountaineer, was at Chamouni, and it required but
little persuasion to induce him to join our party.
Seizing an opportunity one August day when the
rain had stopped for a short while, we decided to try
once more, or at any rate to see what effects the
climatic phases through which we had been passing
had produced on the Aiguille. With Alexander
Burgener and Andreas Maurer still as guides we
ascended once again the slopes by the side of the
Charpoua glacier, and succeeded in discovering a
still more eligible site for a bivouac than on our previous
attempts. A little before four the next morning
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>we extracted each other from our respective sleeping
bags, and made our way rapidly up the glacier. The
snow still lay thick everywhere on the rocks, which
were fearfully cold and glazed with thin layers of
slippery ice; but our purpose was very serious that
day, and we were not to be deterred by anything
short of unwarrantable risk. We intended the climb
to be merely one of exploration, but were resolved to
make it as thorough as possible, and with the best
results. From the middle of the slope leading up to
the ridge the guides went on alone while we stayed to
inspect and work out bit by bit the best routes over
such parts of the mountain as lay within view. In
an hour or two Burgener and Maurer came back to
us, and the former invited me to go on with him back
to the point from which he had just descended. His
invitation was couched in gloomy terms, but there
was a twinkle at the same time in his eye which it
was easy to interpret—<hi rend='italic'>ce n’est que l’œil qui rit</hi>. We
started off and climbed without the rope up the way
which was now so familiar, but which on this occasion,
in consequence of the glazed condition of the
rocks, was as difficult as it could well be; but for a
growing conviction that the upper crags were not
so bad as they looked we should scarcely have persevered.
<q>Wait a little,</q> said Burgener, <q>I will show
you something presently.</q> We reached at last a
great knob of rock close below the ridge, and for a
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>long time sat a little distance apart silently staring
at the precipices of the upper peak. I asked Burgener
what it might be that he had to show me. He
pointed to a little crack some way off, and begged that
I would study it, and then fell again to gazing at it
very hard himself. Though we scarcely knew it at the
time, this was the turning point of our year’s climbing.
Up to that moment I had only felt doubts as to
the inaccessibility of the mountain. Now a certain
feeling of confident elation began to creep over me.
The fact is, that we gradually worked ourselves up
into the right mental condition, and the aspect of a
mountain varies marvellously according to the beholder’s
frame of mind. These same crags had been
by each of us independently, at one time or another,
deliberately pronounced impossible. They were in
no better condition that day than usual, in fact in
much worse order than we had often seen them
before. Yet, notwithstanding that good judges
had ridiculed the idea of finding a way up the precipitous
wall, the prospect looked different that day
as turn by turn we screwed our determination up to
the sticking point. Here and there we could clearly
trace short bits of practicable rock ledges along which
a man might walk, or over which at any rate he might
transport himself, while cracks and irregularities
seemed to develop as we looked. Gradually, uniting
and communicating passages appeared to form. Faster
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>and faster did our thoughts travel, and at last we rose
and turned to each other. The same train of ideas
had independently been passing through our minds.
Burgener’s face flushed, his eyes brightened, and he
struck a great blow with his axe as we exclaimed
almost together, <q>It must, and it shall be done!</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">A difficult descent</note>

<p>
The rest of the day was devoted to bringing
down the long ladder, which had previously been
deposited close below the summit of the ridge, to a
point much lower and nearer to the main peak. This
ladder had not hitherto been of the slightest assistance
on the rocks, and had indeed proved a source of
constant anxiety and worry, for it was ever prone to
precipitate its lumbering form headlong down the
slope. We had, it is true, used it occasionally on the
glacier to bridge over the crevasses, and had saved
some time thereby. Still we were loth to discard its
aid altogether, and accordingly devoted much time
and no little exertion to hauling it about and fixing it
in a place of security. It was late in the evening
before we had made all our preparations for the next
assault and turned to the descent, which proved to
be exceedingly difficult on this occasion. The snow
had become very soft during the day; the late hour
and the melting above caused the stones to fall so
freely down the gully that we gave up that line of
descent and made our way over the face. Often, in
travelling down, we were buried up to the waist in
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>soft snow overlying rock slabs, of which we knew no
more than that they were very smooth and inclined at
a highly inconvenient angle. It was imperative for one
only to move at a time, and the perpetual roping and
unroping was most wearisome. In one place it was
necessary to pay out 150 feet of rope between one
position of comparative security and the one next
below it, till the individual who was thus lowered
looked like a bait at the end of a deep sea line. One
step and the snow would crunch up in a wholesome
manner and yield firm support. The next, and the
leg plunged in as far as it could reach, while the submerged
climber would, literally, struggle in vain to
collect himself. Of course those above, to whom the
duty of paying out the rope was entrusted, would
seize the occasion to jerk as violently at the cord as
a cabman does at his horse’s mouth when he has misguided
the animal round a corner. Now another step
and a layer of snow not more than a foot deep would
slide off with a gentle hiss, exposing bare, black ice
beneath, or treacherous loose stones. Nor were our
difficulties at an end when we reached the foot of the
rocks, for the head of the glacier had fallen away from
the main mass of the mountain, even as an ill-constructed
bow window occasionally dissociates itself
from the façade of a jerry-built villa, and some very
complicated manœuvring was necessary in order to
reach the snow slopes. It was not till late in the
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>evening that we reached Chamouni; but it would have
mattered nothing to us even had we been benighted,
for we had seen all that we had wanted to see, and I
would have staked my existence now on the possibility
of ascending the peak. But the moment was not
yet at hand, and our fortress held out against
surrender to the very last by calling in its old allies,
sou’westerly winds and rainy weather. The whirligig
of time had not yet revolved so as to bring us in our
revenge.

<note place="margin">A blank in the narrative</note>

<p>
Perhaps the monotonous repetition of failures on
the peak influences my recollection of what took
place subsequently to the expedition last mentioned.
Perhaps (as I sometimes think even now) an intense
desire to accomplish our ambition ripened into a
realisation of actual occurrences which really were only
efforts of imagination. This much I know, that when
on September 7 we sat once more round a blazing
wood fire at the familiar bivouac gazing pensively at
the crackling fuel, it seemed hard to persuade one’s-self
that so much had taken place since our last
attempt. Leaning back against the rock and closing
the eyes for a moment it seemed but a dream, whose
reality could be disproved by an effort of the will,
that we had gone to Zermatt in a storm and hurried
back again in a drizzle on hearing that some other
climbers were intent on our peak; that we had left
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>Chamouni in rain and tried, for the seventeenth time,
in a tempest; that matters had seemed so utterly
hopeless, seeing that the season was far advanced and
the days but short, as to induce me to return to
England, leaving minute directions that if the snow
should chance to melt and the weather to mend I
might be summoned back at once; that after eight-and-forty
hours of sojourn in the fogs of my native
land an intimation had come by telegraph of glad
tidings; that I had posted off straightway by <hi rend='italic'>grande
vitesse</hi> back to Chamouni; that I had arrived there
at four in the morning, in consequence of a little
misadventure, which may be here parenthetically
narrated.
</p>

<note place="margin">A carriage misadventure</note>

<p>
The afternoon diligence from Geneva did not go
beyond Sallanches. However, an ingenious young
man of low commercial morality, who said that he had
a remarkable horse and a super-excellent carriage,
was persuaded to drive me on the remainder of the
way to Chamouni. The young man, observing that
he had been very busy of late and had not been to
bed for two nights (nor had he, as might be judged,
washed or tidied himself since last he sought repose),
took a very hearty drink out of a tumbler and climbed
on to an eminence like a long-legged footstool, which
it appeared was the box seat. With much cracking
of whips and various ill-tempered remarks to his
horse we started with success, aided by the efforts of a
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>well-meaning person (judging by the way in which he
wore his braces loosely encircling his waist, devoted to
the tending of horses), who, to oblige his friend the
driver, ran suddenly at the slothful animal in the
shafts and punched the beast very heartily in the ribs
with his fist. Before we had gone a mile our troubles
began. The coachman’s ill-humour subsided, it is true,
but only in consequence of Nature’s soft nurse weighing
his eyelids down. Accordingly I got out my axe and
poked him in the back when he curled up under the influence
of his fatigue. This made him swear a good
deal, but for a time the device was successful enough.
Gradually the monotonous jangling of the harness bells
induced a somnolent disposition in me too, and I conceived
then the brilliant idea, as we were ascending
the long hill near St. Gervais at a walk, of planting
the head of the axe against my own chest and arranging
the weapon in such a way that the spike was in
close contact with the small of the driver’s back, so
that when he fell back it would run into him. Of a
sudden I opened my eyes to find that the jangling had
ceased and the carriage stopped. We were undoubtedly
at Chamouni, and the journey was at an end.
Such, however, was not quite the case. As a matter
of fact, we were not 200 yards further up the hill, the
horse was peacefully grazing by the roadside, and
the young man had eluded my artful contrivance by
falling forwards off the box, where he lay crumpled up
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>into a shapeless heap, peacefully asleep, entangled
between the shafts, the traces, the splinter bar, and the
horse’s tail.
</p>

<p>
I rubbed my eyes and forced away by an effort the
confused jumble and whirl of thoughts that were
crowding through the brain. It was not the sound of
the parting farewell as the diligence lumbered away
from Chamouni, nor the slow heavy clank of the
railway carriages as they entered the station, nor the
voices of the railway porters that rang in my ears.
Voices there were, but they were familiar. I started
up and looked around. Surely that was the familiar
outline of the Aiguille du Dru clear and bright above;
surely that was Hartley (occupied for the moment in
mollifying the effects of sunburn by anointing his face
with the contents of a little squeeze-bottle), and there
was Burgener; but what was this untidy, sleeping
mass at our feet? Gradually it dawned upon me that
I was but inverting a psychological process and trying
to make a dream out of a reality. Hartley was there;
Burgener was there; and the uncomely bundle was
the outward form of the most incompetent guide in
all the Alps. It was not till next day that we
learnt that this creature had previously distinguished
himself by utter imbecility in a difficult ascent up the
north face of the Zermatt Breithorn, nor did we till
the next day fully realise how bad a guide a man
ranking as such might be. We kicked him in a
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>suitable place and he awoke; then he made the one
true remark that during our acquaintance with him
he was heard to utter. He said he had been drunk
the day before; with this he relapsed, and during the
remainder of the time he was with us gave expression
to nothing but whining complaints and inaccurate
statements.
</p>

<note place="margin">A strange guide</note>

<p>
From four in the morning of the next day till
seven in the evening, when we reached our bivouac
again, we were climbing without intermission; not
that our imbecile friend took any very active share
in the day’s amusement. He was roped as last man
in the caravan, and Hartley had to drag him up the
glacier. He was as slow of foot as he was of understanding,
and took no interest in the expedition. Twice
we pointed out to him half-hidden crevasses and
begged that he would be careful. Twice did he
acknowledge our courtesy by disappearing abruptly
into the snowy depths. Then he favoured us with a
short biographical sketch of his wife, her attributes,
and her affection for himself: he narrated the chief
characteristics of his children, and dilated on the
responsible position that as father of a family
(probably all crétins, if there be any truth in the
hereditary transmission of parental qualities) he considered
that he occupied. Finally, as he appeared
disposed to give us at length a memoir of his grandfather
deceased, we decided to unrope him and let
<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>him have his own way in peace. For seven hours
did he crouch under a little rock, not daring to move
either up or down, or even to take the knapsack off
his back.
</p>

<p>
For the first time on this occasion did we succeed
in climbing on to the main peak well above the level
of the ridge we had so often reached, by means of
leaving the gully at a much earlier point than usual.
We followed the exact line that we had marked out
mentally on the last occasion. At first progress was
easy, but we could only make our way very slowly,
seeing that we had but one short rope and only
one guide; for we had injudiciously left the longer
spare rope with our feeble-minded guide below, and
no shouts or implorations could induce him to make
his way up to us, nor had we leisure to go down
to him; so we had to make the best of matters as
they were. We soon found a place where the
ladder might be of service, and spent some time in
placing it in a position in which it remains I believe
till this day.
</p>

<p>
Now, personal considerations had to a great extent
to be lost sight of in the desire to make the most of
the day, and the result was that Hartley must have
had a very bad time of it. Unfortunately perhaps for
him he was by far the lightest member of the party;
accordingly we argued that he was far less likely to
break the rickety old ladder than we were. Again,
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>as the lightest weight, he was most conveniently
lowered down first over awkward places when they
occurred.
</p>

<note place="margin">Our <q>jeune premier</q></note>

<p>
In the times which are spoken of as old, and which
have also, for some not very definable reason, the
prefix good, if you wanted your chimneys swept
you did not employ an individual now dignified
by the title of a Ramoneur, but you adopted the
simpler plan of calling in a master sweep. This
person would come attended by a satellite, who
wore the outward form of a boy and was gifted
with certain special physical attributes. Especially
was it necessary that the boy should be of such a size
and shape as to fit nicely to the chimney, not so
loosely on the one hand as to have any difficulty in
ascending by means of his knees and elbows, nor so
tightly on the other as to run any peril of being
wedged in. The boy was then inserted into the
chimney and did all the work, while the master remained
below or sat expectant on the roof to encourage,
to preside over, and subsequently to profit by, his
apprentice’s exertions. We adopted much the same
principle. Hartley, as the lightest, was cast for the <hi rend='italic'>rôle</hi>
of the <q>jeune premier</q> or boy, while Burgener and
I on physical grounds alone filled the part, however
unworthily, of the master sweep. As a play not infrequently
owes its success to one actor, so did our
<q>jeune premier,</q> sometimes very literally, pull us
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>through on the present occasion. Gallantly indeed
did he fulfil his duty. Whether climbing up a ladder
slightly out of the perpendicular, leaning against
nothing in particular and with overhanging rocks
above; whether let down by a rope tied round his
waist, so that he dangled like the sign of the <q>Golden
Fleece</q> outside a haberdasher’s shop, or hauled up
smooth slabs of rock with his raiment in an untidy
heap around his neck; in each and all of these exercises
he was equally at home, and would be let down
or would come up smiling. One place gave us great
difficulty. An excessively steep wall of rock presented
itself and seemed to bar the way to a higher level. A
narrow crack ran some little way up the face, but
above the rock was slightly overhanging, and the water
trickling from some higher point had led to the formation
of a huge bunch of gigantic icicles, which hung
down from above. It was necessary to get past these,
but impossible to cut them away, as they would have
fallen on us below. Burgener climbed a little way up
the face, planted his back against it, and held on to
the ladder in front of him, while I did the same just
below: by this means we kept the ladder almost perpendicular,
but feared to press the highest rung
heavily against the icicles above lest we should break
them off. We now invited Hartley to mount up.
For the first few steps it was easy enough; but the
leverage was more and more against us as he climbed
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>higher, seeing that he could not touch the rock, and
the strain on our arms below was very severe. However,
he got safely to the top and disappeared from
view. The performance was a brilliant one, but, fortunately,
had not to be repeated; as on a subsequent
occasion, by a deviation of about fifteen or twenty
feet, we climbed to the same spot in a few minutes
with perfect ease and without using any ladder at all.
On this occasion, however, we must have spent fully
an hour while Hartley performed his feats, which
were not unworthy of a Japanese acrobat. Every
few feet of the mountain at this part gave us difficulty,
and it was curious to notice how, on this the first
occasion of travelling over the rock face, we often
selected the wrong route in points of detail. We
ascended from twenty to fifty feet, then surveyed
right and left, up and down, before going any further.
The minutes slipped by fast, but I have no doubt now
that if we had had time we might have ascended to
the final arête on this occasion. We had often to
retrace our steps, and whenever we did so found some
slightly different line by which time could have been
saved. Though the way was always difficult nothing
was impossible, and when the word at last was
given, owing to the failing light, to descend, we had
every reason to be satisfied with the result of the
day’s exploration. There seemed to be little doubt
that we had traversed the most difficult part of the
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>mountain, and, indeed, we found on a later occasion,
with one or two notable exceptions, that such was
the case.
</p>

<note place="margin">An acrobatic performance</note>

<p>
However, at the time we did not think that, even
if it were possible, it would be at all advisable to
make our next attempt without a second guide. A
telegram had been sent to Kaspar Maurer, instructing
him to join us at the bivouac with all possible expedition.
The excitement was thus kept up to the
very last, for we knew not whether the message might
have reached him, and the days of fine weather were
precious.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the evening when we reached again
the head of the glacier, and the point where we had
left the feeble creature who had started with us as a
second guide. On beholding us once more he wept
copiously, but whether his tears were those of gratitude
for release from the cramped position in which he
had spent his entire day, or of joy at seeing us safe
again, or whether they were the natural overflow of
an imbecile intellect stirred by any emotion whatever,
it were hard to say; at any rate he wept, and then
fell to a description of some interesting details concerning
the proper mode of bringing up infants, and
the duties of parents towards their children: the
most important of which, in his estimation, was that
the father of a family should run no risk whatever
on a mountain. Reaching our bivouac, we
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>looked anxiously down over the glacier for any
signs of Kaspar Maurer. Two or three parties
were seen crawling homewards towards the Montanvert
over the ice-fields, but no signs of our guide
were visible. As the shades of night, however, were
falling, we were able indistinctly to see in the far-off
distance a little black dot skipping over the Mer de
Glace with great activity. Most eagerly did we watch
the apparition, and when finally it headed in our
direction and all doubt was removed as to the personality,
we felt that our constant ill-luck was at last
on the eve of changing. However, it was not till two
days later that we left Chamouni once more for the
nineteenth and, as it proved, for the last time to try
the peak.
</p>

<note place="margin">Our nineteenth attempt</note>

<p>
On September 11, we sat on the rocks a few
feet above the camping-place. Never before had we
been so confident of success. The next day’s climb
was no longer to be one of exploration. We were
to start as early as the light would permit, and we
were to go up and always up, if necessary till the
light should fail. Possibly we might have succeeded
long before if we had had the same amount of determination
to do so that we were possessed with on
this occasion. We had made up our minds to succeed,
and felt as if all our previous attempts had been but
a sort of training for this special occasion. We had
gone so far as to instruct our friends below to look
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>out for us on the summit between twelve and two the
next day. We had even gone to the length of bringing
a stick wherewith to make a flag-staff on the top.
Still one, and that a very familiar source of disquietude,
harassed us as our eyes turned anxiously
to the west. A single huge band of cloud hung heavily
right across the sky, and looked like a harbinger of
evil, for it was of a livid colour above, and tinged
with a deep crimson red below. My companion was
despondent at the prospect it suggested, and the
guides tapped their teeth with their forefingers when
they looked in that direction; but it was suggested
by a more sanguine person that its form and very
watery look suggested a Band of Hope. An insinuating
smell of savoury soup was wafted up gently
from below—
</p>
    <lg>
<l>Stealing and giving odour.</l>
</lg>
    <p>We took courage; then descended to the tent, and took
sustenance.
</p>

<p>
There was no difficulty experienced in making an
early start the next day, and the moment the grey
light allowed us to see our way we set off. On such
occasions, when the mind is strung up to a high pitch
of excitement, odd and trivial little details and incidents
fix themselves indelibly on the memory. I
can recall as distinctly now, as if it had only happened
a moment ago, the exact tone of voice in which
Burgener, on looking out of the tent, announced that
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>the weather would do. Burgener and Kaspar Maurer
were now our guides, for our old enemy with the
family ties had been paid off and sent away with a
flea in his ear—an almost unnecessary adjunct, as
anyone who had slept in the same tent with him
could testify. Notwithstanding that Maurer was far
from well, and rather weak, we mounted rapidly at
first, for the way was by this time familiar enough,
and we all meant business.
</p>

<note place="margin">The rocks of the Dru</note>

<p>
Our position now was this. By our exploration on
the last occasion we had ascertained that it was possible
to ascend to a great height on the main mass of the
mountain. From the slope of the rocks, and from the
shape of the mountain, we felt sure that the final crest
would be easy enough. We had then to find a way still
up the face, from the point where we had turned back on
our last attempt, to some point on the final ridge of
the mountain. The rocks on this part we had never
been able to examine very closely, for it is necessary
to cross well over to the south-eastern face while
ascending from the ridge between the Aiguille du Dru
and the Aiguille Verte. A great projecting buttress of
rock, some two or three hundred feet in height, cuts off
the view of that part of the mountain over which we
now hoped to make our way. By turning up straight
behind this buttress, we hoped to hit off and reach
the final crest just above the point where it merges
into the precipitous north-eastern wall visible from
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>the Chapeau. This part of the mountain can only be
seen from the very head of the Glacier de la Charpoua
just under the mass of the Aiguille Verte. But this
point of view is too far off for accurate observations,
and the strip of mountain was practically, therefore,
a <hi rend='italic'>terra incognita</hi> to us.
</p>

<note place="margin">What next?</note>

<p>
We followed the gully running up from the head
of the glacier towards the ridge above mentioned,
keeping well to the left. Before long it was necessary
to cross the gully on to the main peak. To make the
topography clearer a somewhat prosaic and domestic
simile may be employed. The Aiguille du Dru and the
Aiguille Verte are connected by a long sharp ridge, towards
which we were now climbing; and this ridge is let
in as it were into the south-eastern side of the Aiguille
du Dru, much as a comb may be stuck into the middle
of a hairbrush, the latter article representing the main
peak. Here we employed the ladder which had been
placed in the right position the day previously. Right
glad were we to see the rickety old structure which
had now spent four years on the mountain, and was
much the worse for it. It creaked and groaned dismally
under our weight and ran sharp splinters into
us at all points of contact, but yet there was a certain
companionship about the old ladder, and we seemed
almost to regret that it was not destined to share
more in our prospective success. A few steps on and
we came to a rough cleft some five-and-twenty feet
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>in depth, which had to be descended. A double rope
was fastened to a projecting crag, and we swung ourselves
down as if we were barrels of split peas going
into a ship’s hold; then to the ascent again, and the
excitement waxed stronger as we drew nearer to the
doubtful part of the mountain. Still, we did not
anticipate insuperable obstacles; for I think we were
possessed with a determination to succeed, which is a
sensation often spoken of as a presentiment of success.
A short climb up an easy broken gully, and of a
sudden we seemed to be brought to a standstill. A
little ledge at our feet curled round a projecting crag
on the left. <q>What are we to do now?</q> said Burgener,
but with a smile on his face that left no doubt
as to the answer. He lay flat down on the ledge and
wriggled round the projection, disappearing suddenly
from view as if the rock had swallowed him up. A
shout proclaimed that his expectations had not been
deceived, and we were bidden to follow; and follow we
did, sticking to the flat face of the rock with all our
power, and progressing like the skates down the glass
sides of an aquarium tank. When the last man
joined us we found ourselves all huddled together on
a very little ledge indeed, while an overhanging rock
above compelled us to assume the anomalous attitude
enforced on the occupant of a little-ease dungeon.
What next? An eager look up solved part of the
doubt. <q>There is the way,</q> said Burgener, leaning
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>back to get a view. <q>Oh, indeed,</q> we answered. No
doubt there was a way, and we were glad to hear that
it was possible to get up it. The attractions of the
route consisted of a narrow flat gully plastered up
with ice, exceeding straight and steep and crowned at
the top with a pendulous mass of enormous icicles.
The gully resembled a half-open book standing up
on end. Enthusiasts in rock-climbing who have
ascended the Riffelhorn from the Görner Glacier side
will have met with a similar gully, but, as a rule, free
from ice, which, in the present instance, constituted
the chief difficulty. The ice, filling up the receding
angle from top to bottom, rendered it impossible to
find hand-hold on the rocks, and it was exceedingly
difficult to cut steps in such a place, for the slabs of
ice were prone to break away entire. However, the
guides said they could get up, and asked us to keep
out of the way of chance fragments of ice which might
fall down as they ascended. So we tucked ourselves
away on one side, and they fell to as difficult a business
as could well be imagined. The rope was
discarded, and slowly they worked up, their backs and
elbows against one sloping wall, their feet against the
other. But the angle was too wide to give security to
this position, the more especially that with shortened
axes they were compelled to hack out enough of the ice
to reveal the rock below. In such places the ice is but
loosely adherent, being raised up from the face much
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>as pie-crust dissociates itself from the fruit beneath
under the influence of the oven. Strike lightly with
the axe, and a hollow sound is yielded without much
impression on the ice; strike hard, and the whole mass
breaks away. But the latter method is the right one to
adopt, though it necessitates very hard work. No steps
are really reliable when cut in ice of this description.
</p>

<note place="margin">A narrow escape</note>

<p>
The masses of ice, coming down harder and harder
as they ascended without intermission, showed how
they were working, and the only consolation that we
had during a time that we felt to be critical, was that
the guides were not likely to expend so much labour
unless they thought that some good result would come
of it. Suddenly there came a sharp shout and cry; then
a crash as a great slab of ice, falling from above, was
dashed into pieces at our feet and leaped into the air;
then a brief pause, and we knew not what would
happen next. Either the gully had been ascended
or the guides had been pounded, and failure here
might be failure altogether. It is true that Hartley
and I had urged the guides to find a way some little
distance to the right of the line on which they were
now working; but they had reported that, though
easy below, the route we had pointed out was impossible
above.<note place="foot">It has transpired since that our judgment happened to be right
in this matter, and we might probably have saved an hour or more
at this part of the ascent.</note> A faint scratching noise close above
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>us, as of a mouse perambulating behind a wainscot.
We look up. It is the end of a rope. We seize it, and
our pull from below is answered by a triumphant yell
from above as the line is drawn taut. Fastening the
end around my waist, I started forth. The gully
was a scene of ruin, and I could hardly have believed
that two axes in so short a time could have dealt so
much destruction. Nowhere were the guides visible,
and in another moment there was a curious sense of
solitariness as I battled with the obstacles, aided in
no small degree by the rope. The top of the gully
was blocked up by a great cube of rock, dripping still
where the icicles had just been broken off. The
situation appeared to me to demand deliberation,
though it was not accorded. <q>Come on,</q> said voices
from above. <q>Up you go,</q> said a voice from below.
I leaned as far back as I could, and felt about for a
hand-hold. There was none. Everything seemed
smooth. Then right, then left; still none. So I
smiled feebly to myself, and called out, <q>Wait a minute.</q>
This was of course taken as an invitation to pull
vigorously, and, struggling and kicking like a spider
irritated by tobacco smoke, I topped the rock and
lent a hand on the rope for Hartley to follow. Then
we learnt that a great mass of ice had broken away
under Maurer’s feet while they were in the gully,
and that he must have fallen had not Burgener
pinned him to the rock with one hand. From the
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>number of times that this escape was described to us
during that day and the next, I am inclined to think
that it was rather a near thing. At the time, and
often since, I have questioned myself as to whether
we could have got up this passage without the rope
let down from above. I think either of us could
have done it in time with a companion. It was
necessary for two to be in the gully at the same
time, to assist each other. It was necessary also to
discard the rope, which in such a place could only be
a source of danger. But no amateur should have
tried the passage on that occasion without confidence
in his own powers, and without absolute knowledge of
the limit of his own powers. If the gully had been
free from ice it would have been much easier.
</p>

<note place="margin">The final scramble</note>

<p>
<q>The worst is over now,</q> said Burgener. I was
glad to hear it, but, looking upwards, had my doubts.
The higher we went the bigger the rocks seemed to be.
Still there was a way, and it was not so very unlike
what I had, times out of mind, pictured to myself in
imagination. Another tough scramble and we stood
on a comparatively extensive ledge. With elation we
observed that we had now climbed more than half of
the only part of the mountain of the nature of which
we were uncertain. A few steps on and Burgener
grasped me suddenly by the arm. <q>Do you see the
great red rock up yonder?</q> he whispered, hoarse with
excitement—<q>in ten minutes we shall be there and on
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>the arête, and then——</q> Nothing could stop us now;
but a feverish anxiety to see what lay beyond, to look
on the final slope which we knew must be easy, impelled
us on, and we worked harder than ever to
overcome the last few obstacles. The ten minutes
expanded into something like thirty before we really
reached the rock. Of a sudden the mountain seemed
to change its form. For hours we had been climbing
the hard, dry rocks. Now these appeared suddenly to
vanish from under our feet, and once again our eyes
fell on snow which lay thick, half hiding, half revealing,
the final slope of the ridge. A glance along it
showed that we had not misjudged. Even the cautious
Maurer admitted that, as far as we could see, all
appeared promising. And now, with the prize almost
within our grasp, a strange desire to halt and hang
back came on. Burgener tapped the rock with his
axe, and we seemed somehow to regret that the way in
front of us must prove comparatively easy. Our foe
had almost yielded, and it appeared something like
cruelty to administer the final <hi rend='italic'>coup de grâce</hi>. We
could already anticipate the half-sad feeling with
which we should reach the top itself. It needed but
little to make the feeling give way. Some one cried
<q>Forwards,</q> and instantly we were all in our places
again, and the leader’s axe crashed through the
layers of snow into the hard blue ice beneath. A
dozen steps, and then a short bit of rock scramble;
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>then more steps along the south side of the ridge,
followed by more rock, and the ridge beyond, which
had been hidden for a minute or two, stretched out
before us again as we topped the first eminence.
Better and better it looked as we went on. <q>See
there,</q> cried Burgener suddenly, <q>the actual top!</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">Our foe is vanquished</note>

<p>
There was no possibility of mistaking the two huge
stones we had so often looked at from below. They
seemed, in the excitement of the moment, misty and
blurred for a brief space, but grew clear again as I
passed my hand over my eyes and seemed to swallow
something. A few feet below the pinnacles and on
the left was one of those strange arches formed by a
great transverse boulder, so common near the summits
of these aiguilles, and through the hole we could see
blue sky. Nothing could lay beyond, and, still better,
nothing could be above. On again, while we could
scarcely stand still in the great steps the leader set
his teeth to hack out. Then there came a short
troublesome bit of snow scramble, where the heaped-up
cornice had fallen back from the final rock. There
we paused for a moment, for the summit was but a
few feet from us, and Hartley, who was ahead,
courteously allowed me to unrope and go on first. In
a few seconds I clutched at the last broken rocks, and
hauled myself up on to the sloping summit. There
for a moment I stood alone gazing down on Chamouni.
The holiday dream of five years was accomplished;
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>the Aiguille du Dru was climbed. Where in the wide
world will you find a sport able to yield pleasure like
this?
</p>

<p>
Mountaineers are often asked, <q>What did you do
when you got to the top?</q> With regard to this peak
the same question has often been put to me, and I
have often answered it, but, it must be confessed,
always suppressing one or two facts. I do not know
why I should conceal them now any longer, the more
especially as I think there is a moral to be drawn
from my experience, or I would still keep it locked up.
I had tried so hard and so long to get up this little
peak, that some reaction of mind was not improbable;
but it took a turn which I had never before and
have never since experienced in the slightest degree.
For a second or two—it cannot have been longer—all
the past seemed blotted out, all consciousness
of self, all desire of life was lost, and I was
seized with an impulse almost incontrollable to
throw myself down the vertical precipice which lay
immediately at my feet. I know not now, though
the feeling is still and always will be intensely vivid,
how it was resisted, but at the sound of the voices
below the faculties seemed to return each to its
proper place, and with the restoration of the <anchor id="corr216"/><corr sic="menta">mental</corr>
balance the momentary idea of violently overturning
the physical balance vanished. What has happened
to one may have happened to others. It appeared
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>to me quite different from what is known as mountain
vertigo. In fact, I never moved at all from
where I stood, and awoke, as it were, to find myself
looking calmly down the identical place. It may be
that the mental equilibrium under similar circumstances
has not always been so fortunately restored,
and that thus calamities on the mountains may have
taken place. In another minute the rest of the party
ascended, and we were all reposing on the hard-won
summit.
</p>

<note place="margin">On the summit</note>

<p>
Far below a little white speck representing Couttet’s
Hotel was well in view, and towards this we
directed our telescope. We could make out a few
individuals wandering listlessly about, but there did
not seem to be much excitement; in front of the
Imperial Hotel, however, we were pleased to imagine
that we saw somebody gazing in our direction.
Accordingly, with much pomp and ceremony, the
stick—which it may be stated was borrowed without
leave—was fixed into a little cleft and tightly wedged
in; then, to my horror, Burgener, with many chuckles
at his own foresight and at the completeness of his
equipment, produced from a concealed pocket a piece
of scarlet flannel strongly suggestive of a baby’s under
garment, and tied it on to the stick. I protested in
vain; in a moment the objectionable rag was floating
proudly in the breeze. However, it seemed to want
airing. Determined that our ascent should be placed
<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>beyond doubt in the eyes of any subsequent visitors,
we ransacked our stores, and were enabled to leave the
following articles:—One half-pint bottle containing our
names, preserved by a paper stopper from the inclemency
of the weather; two wooden wedges of
unknown use, two ends of string, three burnt fusees,
divers chips, one stone man of dwarf proportions, the
tenpenny stick, and the infant’s petticoat.
</p>

<p>
There is a popular belief that the main object of
climbing up a mountain is to get a view from the top.
It may therefore be a matter of regret to some, but it
will certainly be a matter of great congratulation to
many others, that of the view obtained I can say but
little. Chamouni looked very nice, however, from this
distance. Turning towards the Aiguille Verte we were
astonished to notice that this great mass appeared to
tower far less above us than might have been expected
from its much greater height and close proximity. On
the other hand, the lower south-eastern peak of the
Aiguille du Dru seemed much more below us than we
had imagined would be the case. It is a moot point
in mountaineering circles how much difference between
two closely contiguous points is necessary in order
that they may be rated as individual peaks. At the
time we estimated the difference between the two
peaks of our Aiguille to be about 80 feet, but Hartley,
who has since climbed the lower point, estimates that
the difference between the two must be at the very
<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>least 120 feet. Still, the comparative meagreness of
the panorama did not affect our spirits, nor detract
in any appreciable degree from the completeness of
the expedition. The Aiguille du Dru is essentially an
expedition only for those who love a good climb for
climbing’s sake. Every step, every bit of scrambling,
was—and is still—a pleasure.
</p>

<note place="margin">The return journey</note>

<p>
We had reached the top at half-past twelve, so
that our estimate of the time required had been a
very accurate one. After spending three-quarters of
an hour on the summit we turned to the descent with
regret, and possessed with much the same feeling as a
schoolboy on Black Monday, who takes an affectionate
farewell of all sorts of inanimate objects. Very difficult
the descent proved to be. We were so anxious,
now that our efforts had been finally crowned with
success, that the whole expedition should pass off
without the least misadventure, that we went much
more slowly, and took more elaborate precautions than
under ordinary circumstances would have been deemed
necessary. From the start we had agreed that, whatever
the hour, nothing should persuade us to hurry
the least in the descent. On such mountains, however,
as the Aiguille du Dru it is easier on the whole
to get down than to get up, especially if a good supply
of spare rope be included in the equipment. At three
places we found it advisable to fix ropes in order to
assist our progress. It was curious to observe how
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>marvellously the aspect of the mountain was changed
as we looked down the places up which we had
climbed so recently; and there were so many deviations
from the straight line, that the way was very
difficult to find at all. Indeed, Burgener alone could
hit it off with certainty, and, though last on the rope,
directed the way without ever making the slightest
mistake at any part. We followed precisely the same
route as in ascending, and noticed few if any places
where this route was capable of improvement, or even
of alteration.
</p>

<p>
Not till nearly five o’clock did we regain our abandoned
store of provisions; the sight of the little white
packets, and especially of a certain can of tinned
meat, seen at a considerable distance below, incited
us to great exertions, for since ten in the morning we
had partaken of nothing but a sandwich crushed
out of all recognisable shape. Ignoring the probability
of being benighted on the rocks, we caroused
merrily on seltzer water and the contents of the tin
can. It seemed almost a pity to quit for good these
familiar rocks on which we had spent such a glorious
time, and the sun was sinking low behind the Brévent
range, and the rocks were all darkened in the grey
shadows, before the guides could persuade us to pack
up and resume our journey. Very little time was
lost in descending when we had once started, but
before we had reached a certain little sloping ledge
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>furnished with a collection of little pointed stones, and
known as the breakfast place, the darkness had overtaken
us. The glacier lay only a few feet below, when
the mist which had been long threatening swept up
and closed in around us. The crevasses at the head
of the glacier were so complicated, and the snow
bridges so fragile, that we thought it wiser not to go
on at once, but to wait till the snow should have had
time to harden. So we sat down under an overhanging
rock, and made believe that we enjoyed the fun.
Hartley wedged a stone under his waist, as if he were
the hind wheel of a waggon going uphill, and imitated
the inaction and attitude of a person going to sleep.
The guides retired to a little distance and, as is their
wont when inactive, fell to a warm discussion over the
dimensions of the different chamois they had shot,
each of course outvying the other in turn. The game
has this merit at least, when there is plenty of spare time
at disposal, that if the players only begin low enough
down in the animal scale it is practically unlimited.
</p>

<note place="margin">Benighted</note>

<p>
Before long the situation ceased to be amusing,
as we found that we had managed to get wet through
in the gully, and that the slowly falling temperature
was exceedingly unpleasant. I converted a cowhide
knapsack into a temporary foot-warmer, much to the
detriment of such articles of food as were still stored
in its recesses, and tucked a boot under each arm
to keep the leather from hardening. Then we fell
<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>to discussing what we would have next day for breakfast,
and for some two hours found a certain amount
of solace in disputing over the merits of divers dainty
dishes. Even this fertile subject failed at length to
give adequate satisfaction. The ledge became colder
and colder, and new spiky little points appeared
to develop every moment. The argument of the
sportsmen grew fainter, and we became slowly chilled
through. For a while the mind became more active,
but less logical, and fanciful visions crowded thickly
through it. On such occasions it is seldom possible
to fix the thoughts on events immediately past. To
my drowsy gaze the mist seemed to take the form of
our native fogs, while the condition of the ledge suggested
obtrusively a newly macadamised road. Almost
at will I could transport myself in imagination to the
metropolis I had so recently left, or back again to the
wild little ledge on which we were stranded. Following
up the train of sensations, it was easy to conceive
how reason might fail altogether, and how gradually,
as the senses became numbed one by one, delirium
might supervene from cold and exposure—as has often
happened to arctic travellers. The thoughts flew off
far afield, and pictured the exact contrast of the immediate
surroundings. I saw a brilliantly lighted street
with long rows of flaming lamps. The windows of the
clubhouses shone out as great red and orange squares
and oblongs. Carriages dashed by, cabs oscillated down
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>the roads. Elegantly attired youths about to commence
their wakeful period (why are men who only
know the seamy side of life called <q>men of the world</q>?
Is it so bad a world, my masters?) were strolling off
to places of entertainment. A feeble, ragged creature
crept along in the shadows. A worn, bright-eyed girl,
just free from work which had begun at early dawn,
dragged her aching limbs homewards, but stopped a
moment to glance with envy at a mamma and two
fair daughters crossing the pavement to their carriage;
light, life, bustle, crowding everywhere. Faster and
faster follow the shifting scenes till the visions jostle
and become confused——A crack, a distant sound of
a falling shower of stones, a hiss as they fall on to the
snow slopes below. The eyes open, but the mind
only half awakes, and almost immediately dreams
again, with changed visions of comfortable rooms, in
which the flickering light of a coal fire now throws
up, now half conceals the close-drawn curtains, or the
familiar form of books and pictures; visions of some
formless individual with slippered feet disposed at
judicious distance from the blazing coals, of soft
carpets and deep arm-chairs moulded by long use into
the precise intaglio adapted to the human frame;
visions of a warm flood of subdued light, of things
steaming gently with curling wreaths of vapour. All
these passed in order before the mind, called up by
the incantation of discomfort out of the cauldron of
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>misery, like unto the regal display manifested to that
impulsive and somewhat over-married individual,
Macbeth.
</p>

<note place="margin">Shifting scenes</note>

<p>
But before long it was most difficult to picture
these pleasant sights so vividly as to become altogether
oblivious of an exceedingly chilly personality,
and ultimately human nature triumphed, and the <hi rend='italic'>ego</hi>
in a rather frozen state became again paramount.
I had begun to calculate the number of hours we
might have to remain where we were, and the probable
state in which we should be next morning, when
of a sudden the mist lifted, and disclosed the glacier
just below feebly lit up by the rising moon. We
sprang instantly to our feet, almost as instantaneously
returning to our former positions by reason
of the exceeding stiffness and cramp begotten of the
cold. The guides, leaving their discussion at a
point where the last speaker had, in imagination,
shot a chamois about the size of an elephant,
descended to inspect the ice. The snow bridges were
pronounced secure, and we were soon across the crevasses,
but found to our disgust that we had rather
overdone the waiting. The slope was hard frozen,
and in the dim light it was found necessary to cut
steps nearly the whole way down the glacier. For
five hours and a half were we thus engaged, and did
not reach our camp till 2.30 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> Never did the tent
look so comfortable as on that morning. If, as was
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>remarked of Mrs. Gamp’s apartment in Kingsgate
Street, High Holborn, to the contented mind a
cottage is a palace, so to the weary frame may a tent
be a luxurious hotel. We rushed over the loose rocks
by the snout of the glacier, and ran helter-skelter for
our bivouac. From the circumstance that the invariable
struggle for the best pillow was usually brief, and
that one of the party was discovered next morning
wrong end foremost in his sleeping bag with his boots
still on his feet, I am disposed to think that we were
not long in dropping off to sleep; but the unstudied
attitudes of the party suggested rather four revellers
returning from a Greenwich dinner in a four-wheeled
cab over a cobbled road than a company of sober
mountaineers. By seven o’clock, however, the predominant
thought of breakfast so asserted itself that
we woke up and looked out.
</p>

<note place="margin">The camp breaks up</note>

<p>
The first object that met our gaze was a large
sheet of paper, affixed to the rock just in front of
the tent, and bearing the simple inscription <q>Hooray!</q>
This led us to surmise that our success was already
known below; for the author of the legend had
returned to Chamouni the previous evening, after
having seen us on the summit. To each man was
apportioned the burden he should bear of the camp
equipage. Such a collection of pots and pans and other
paraphernalia had we amassed gradually during our
stay, that our appearance as we crossed the glacier
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>suggested rather that of certain inhabitants of Lagado
mentioned in Gulliver’s voyage to Laputa. By nine
o’clock we had deposited our burdens at the Montanvert
and, disregarding the principles of the sages
above referred to, ventured to corrode our lungs by
articulating our wants to the landlord. This worthy
received us with more than his usual affability, for the
tidings of our success had in truth already reached
the inn. A bottle of conical form was produced, the
cork drawn with a monstrous explosion, and some
very indifferent fluid poured out as a token of congratulation.
In spite of, perhaps in consequence of,
these early libations, we skipped down the well-worn
and somewhat unsavoury path with great nimbleness,
and in an hour or so found ourselves on the level path
leading along the valley to Chamouni by the English
church. There, I am pleased to record, the first man
to congratulate us was our old friend M. Gabriel
Loppé, without whose kindly sympathy and constant
encouragement I doubt if we should have ever persevered
to our successful end. It mattered little to
us that but few of the Chamouni guides gave us credit
for having really ascended the peak, for most of them
maintained that we had merely reached a point on the
south-east face of the lower summit; indeed, to those
not so familiar with the details of the mountain as
we were, it might well seem hard to realise that the
crag jutting out on the right, as seen from Chamouni,
is really the actual summit.
</p>

<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>

<p>
Such is the record of the most fascinating rock
climb with which I am acquainted. From beginning
to end it is interesting. There is no wearisome
tramping over loose moraine and no great extent of
snow-field to traverse. The rocks are wondrously firm
and big, and peculiarly unlike those on other mountains,
even on many of the aiguilles about Chamouni.
</p>
<note place="margin">Mountaineering morality</note>
<p>
An odd code of mountaineering morality has gradually
sprung into existence, and ideas as to what is
fair and sportsmanlike in mountain climbing are somewhat
peculiar. People speak somewhat vaguely of
<q>artificial aid,</q> and are wont to criticise in very severe
language the employment of such assistance, at the
same time finding it rather hard, if driven into a corner,
to define what they mean by the term. It would seem
that artificial aid may signify the driving of iron pegs
into rocks when nature has provided insufficient hand
or foot-hold. Such a proceeding is considered highly
improper. To cut a step in ice is right, but to chisel
out a step on rock is in the highest degree unjustifiable.
Again, a ladder may be used without critical animadversion
to bridge a crevasse, but its employment over
a rock cleft is tabooed. A certain amount of mountaineering
equipment is not only considered proper,
but those who go on the mountains without it are
spoken of with great asperity, and called very hard
names; but the equipment must not include anything
beyond hobnails, rope, axes, and possibly a ladder for
<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>a crevasse; any other contrivance is sniffed at contemptuously
as artificial aid. Rockets and such like
are usually only mentioned in order to be condemned;
while grapnels, chains, and crampons are held to be
the inventions of the fiend. Why these unwritten
laws should exist in such an imaginary code it is hard
to see. Perhaps we must not consider too curiously
on the matter. For my own part, if it could be
proved that by no possible means could a given bad
passage be traversed without some such aid, nor turned
by another route, I should not hesitate to adopt any
mechanical means to the desired end. As a matter
of fact, in the Alps scarcely any such places exist for
those who have taken the trouble to learn how to
climb, and there are none on the Aiguille du Dru.
We used our ladder often enough in exploring the
mountain, but when we actually ascended it we employed
it in one place only, saving thereby at least
an hour of invaluable time. Indeed, subsequent explorers
have found such to be the case; and Mr. W.
E. Davidson, in a recent ascent of the mountain, was
able to find his way without invoking the assistance
of either ladder or fixed ropes. In a marvellously
short space of time, too, did he get up and down the
peak on which we had spent hours without number.
Still, this is the fate of all mountains. The mountaineers
who make the third ascent are, usually, able
to sweep away the blushing honours that the first
<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>climbers might fondly hope they had invested the
mountain with. A word, a stroke of the pen, will do
it. The peaks do not yield gradually from their high
estate, but fall, like Lucifer, from summit to ultimate
destination, and are suddenly converted from <q>the most
difficult mountain in the Alps</q> to <q>Oh yes; a fine
peak, but not a patch upon Mount So-and-so.</q> It is
but with the mountains as with other matters of this
life, save in this respect, that once deposed they never
can hope to reign again supreme. Statements concerning
our fellow-creatures when of a depreciatory,
and still more when of a scandal-flavoured, nature, are
always believed by nine people out of ten to be, if not
absolutely true, at any rate well-founded enough for
repetition. A different estimate of the standard of
veracity to be met with in this world is assumed when
the remarks are favourable. Even so may it be, in
some instances, with the mountains. The prestige
that clings to a maiden peak is like the bark on a
wand: peel it off, and it cannot be replaced; the
bough withers, and is cast to one side, its character
permanently altered.
</p>

<note place="margin">Chamouni becomes festive</note>

<p>
We would fain have rested that evening, but the
edict went forth that festivities were to take place in
honour of the ascent, and, to tell the truth, that
evening was not the least fatiguing part of the whole
affair. The opportunity was too good to be lost,
especially as the customary mode of testifying
<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>congratulations by firing off divers podgy little cannons,
had been omitted. Preparations were made for a display
of fireworks on a large scale. Some six rockets of
moderately soaring ambition were placed in order on
the grass-plot in front of the hotel. A skilful pyrotechnist,
who knew the right end to which to apply
the match, was placed in charge, and fussed about
a great deal. A very little table covered with a white
cloth, and on which were displayed several bottles,
reminded the crowd of loafers who assembled expectant
as the darkness came on, that a carousal was
meditated. At last the word was given, and the
pyrotechnist, beaming with pride, advanced bearing
a lighted taper attached to the end of a stick of judicious
length. A hush of expectancy followed, and experienced
persons retired to sheltered corners. The
fireworks behaved as they usually do. They fizzed
prodigiously, and went off in the most unexpected
directions. One rocket, rather weak in the waist,
described, after a little preliminary spluttering, an
exceedingly sharp, corkscrew-like series of curves, and
then turned head-over-heels with astounding rapidity
on the lawn, like a rabbit shot through the head, and
there lay flat, spluttering out its gunpowdery vitals.
Another was perfectly unmoved at the initial application
of the kindling flame, but then suddenly began
to swell up in an alarming way, causing the pyrotechnist,
who had no previous experience of this
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>phenomenon, to retreat somewhat hastily. However,
one of the rockets rose to a height of some five-and-twenty
feet, much to the operator’s satisfaction, and
we were all able to congratulate him warmly on his
contribution to our entertainment as we emerged from
our places of security.
</p>

<note place="margin">Organising the ball</note>

<p>
A series of smaller explosions, resulting from
the drawing of corks, was the next item in the
programme, and appeared to give more general
satisfaction. Then the bell rang, and the master of
the ceremonies announced that the ball was about to
commence. Some over-zealous person had unfortunately
sought to improve the condition of the floor for
dancing, by tracing an arabesque pattern on the
boards with water, using for the purpose a tin pot
with a convenient leak at the bottom. It followed
that the exercise of waltzing in thick boots was more
laborious than graceful. Without, the villagers
crowded at the windows to gaze upon our fantastic
gyrations. But little formality had been observed in
organising the ball; in fact, the ceremony of issuing
cards of invitation had been replaced by ringing a bell
and displaying a placard on which it was announced
that the dance would commence at nine o’clock. However,
the enjoyment appeared to be none the less keen,
for all that the dancers were breathing fairly pure air,
taking no champagne, and not fulfilling any social
duty. But for the costumes the gathering might
<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>have been mistaken for a fashionable entertainment.
All the recognised types to be met with in a London
ball-room were there. The conversation, judging from
the fragments overheard, did not appear to be below the
average standard of intellectuality. The ladies, who
came from the various hotels of Chamouni, displayed, as
most English girls do—<hi rend='italic'>pace</hi> the jealous criticism of certain
French writers, more smart than observant—their
curious faculty of improvising ball costume exactly
suitable to the occasion. There was a young man who
had a pair of white gloves, and was looked upon
with awe in consequence, and who, in the intervals of
the dances, slid about in an elegant manner instead
of walking. There was a middle-aged person of
energetic temperament who skipped and hopped like
the little hills, and kept everything going—including
the refreshments. There was a captious and cynical
person, who frowned horribly, and sat in a corner
in the verandah with an altogether superior air, and
who, in support of the character, smoked a cigar of uncertain
botanical pedigree provided by the hotel, which
disagreed with him and increased his splenetic mood.
Elsewhere, at more fashionable gatherings, he would
have leaned against doorposts, cultivated a dejected
demeanour, and got very much in other people’s way.
There was a pianist who was a very clever artist, and
found out at once the notes that yielded no response
on the instrument, and who, like his more fashionable
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>analogue, regularly required stimulants after playing
a waltz. It mattered little what he played—polka,
waltz, galop, or mazurka—whatever the tune, the
couples all rotated more or less slowly about; so it
was evidently an English gathering. At such impromptu
dances there is always a strong desire to
show off musical talent. No sooner did the hireling
pianist desist than a little cluster gathered around the
instrument, assured him that he must be tired, and
volunteered to play. Finally he was induced to rest,
and a young lady who knew <q>Rousseau’s Dream,</q>
or some tune very like it, triumphantly seated herself
and favoured the company with that air in waltz time,
whereat the unsuccessful candidates for the seat smiled
scornfully at each other, and rolled up their eyes, and
would not dance. So they, in turn, triumphed, and the
young lady blushed, and said she had never seen such
a stupid set of people, and went away and sat by her
parents, and thought the world was indeed hollow.
The hireling came back, and all went on merrily again.
</p>

<note place="margin">Chamouni dances</note>

<p>
In the yard outside the crowd increased. In the
midst of the throng could be seen Maurer, resplendent
in a shirt the front of which was like unto a petrified
bath-towel, wearing a coat many sizes too large, his face
beaming with smiles and shining from the effects
of drinks offered in the spirit of good fellowship on
all sides. Close by stood Burgener, displaying
similar physiognomical phenomena, his natural free
<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>movements hampered by the excessive tightness of some
garments with which an admirer of smaller girth had
presented him. Let us do justice to the guides of
Chamouni, who might not unnaturally have found
some cause for disappointment that the peak had
been captured by strangers in the land. On this
occasion, at any rate, they offered the hand of good
fellowship, and listened with admiring attention while
our guides, in an unknown tongue, expatiated on the
difficulties and dangers they had successfully overcome—difficulties
which did not appear to become
less by frequent repetition. Let us leave them there.
They did their work thoroughly well, and might be
pardoned, under all the circumstances, for a little
swagger.
</p>
<note place="margin">The scene closes in</note>
<p>
The days grow shorter apace. The sun has barely
time to make the ice peaks glisten, ere the cold
shadows creep over again. Snow lies thick on ledge
and cranny, and only the steepest mountain faces
show dark through the powdery veil. Bleak night
winds whistle around the beetling crags and whirl
and chevy the wreathing snow-clouds, making weird
music in these desolate fastnesses, while the glaciers
and snow-fields collect fresh strength against the
time when their relentless destroyer shall attack them
once again at an advantage. The scene is changed.
The clear air, the delicate purity of the Alpine tints
are but recollections, and have given way to fog, mist,
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>slush, and smoke-laden atmosphere. Would you
recall these mountain pictures? Draw close the
curtains, stir the coals into an indignant crackling
blaze, and fashion, in the rising smoke, the mountain
vista. How easy it is to unlock the storehouse of the
mind where these images are stowed away! how these
scenes crowd back into the mind! What keener
charm than to pass in review the memories of these
simple, wholesome pleasures; to see again, as clear as
in the reality, every ledge, every hand and foot-hold;
to feel the fingers tingle and the muscles instinctively
contract at the recollection of some tough scramble
on rock or glacier? The pleasures of the Alps endure
long after the actual experience, and are but invested;
whether the interest can be derived by any one but
the actual investor is a matter for others to decide.
For my own part, I can only wish that any one could
possibly derive a hundredth part of the pleasure in
reading, that I have had in writing, of our adventures.

There are some, and they are considered, on the
whole, fortunate by less highly gifted individuals,
who possess minds as accurately divided up into
receptacles for the storage of valuable material as a
honeycomb. Every scrap of information acquired
by the owner of such a well-ordered intellect is duly
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>sifted, purged, ticketed, and finally pigeon-holed in
its proper cell, whence it could undoubtedly be drawn
out at any future time for reference, were it not for
the fact that the pigeon-holes are all so very much
alike that the geometrically minded man commonly
forgets the number of the shelf to which he has
relegated his item of knowledge. He need not really
regret that this should be the case; persons with this
exceedingly well-ordered form of mind are apt to be
a little too precise for ordinary folk, and may even by
the captious be rated as dull creatures. A love for
the beautiful is not usually associated with excessively
tidy habits of mind. An artist’s studio in apple-pie
order would seem as unnatural as a legal document
drawn up on æsthetic principles. If the truth be told,
the picturesque is always associated with—not to
mince matters—the dirty; and the city of Hygeia,
however commendably free from the latter quality,
would be but a dreary and unattractive town. Nor
would it, as seems to be sometimes supposed, be quite
a paradise to that terrible and minatory person, the
sanitarian. On the contrary, he would probably be
found dining with the undertaker—off approved
viands—and the pair would be bewailing the hard
times.

I knew a man once who was marvellously proud
of a certain little cabinet, devoted to the reception of
keys, all of which were arranged in a remarkably
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>orderly manner. He was fond of demonstrating the
system, which seemed, in truth, highly business-like;
but I lost faith one day in his method, on finding
that he did not know the locks which the several
keys were constructed respectively to open. It is
with the mind’s eye as with the bodily eye. We
are able only to focus sharply one thing at a time,
and the beauty of a given view, from the physiological
standpoint, consists in the softened indistinctness of
all objects out of the range of absolute focus—a fact
of which the early Florentine artists evinced a curious
disregard, and which their modern imitators, who, at
least in our scientific age, ought to know something
of the elementary laws of optics, render themselves
somewhat ridiculous by servilely copying. So is it
also with the memory. A certain indistinctness of
detail often renders the recollection even more pleasing;
we may be able only to reproduce from the
pigeon-hole, as it were, a rather indistinct, blotted-in
impression, but as the artist would be fully justified
in working up such a study into a finished picture, so
may the writer be allowed also to elaborate from his
mental sketch a complete work. Now, in wandering
in those numerous districts in the mountains of Switzerland
which cannot properly be classed as sub-Alpine,
and yet are not lofty enough to warrant their
explorer in dignifying his rambles by the term
<q>climbing,</q> one great charm consists in the fact that,
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>while everything is pleasing, there is no distinct
objective point that we are bidden to admire. The
critical tendency is a very constant factor in human
character, and the chief business the professional
critic has to learn consists in finding out how far he
may legitimately go, and how he may best say what
he is called upon to express. Now even the least
critical of our race, the gushing section of humanity,
feel irresistibly disposed to cavil at anything they are
told they must admire. Perhaps, though, it is not
the critical attributes which come out on such occasions
in them. Possibly it is but an example of that still more
uniformly found characteristic of man and woman,
a quality which, in the process of the descent of our
species, has been handed down without the least alteration
from such lower animals as the mule for instance,
and for which, oddly enough, we have no proper term
in our language this side of the water, but know it as
<q>cussedness.</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">The critical tendency</note>

<p>
Most travellers hear with a slight feeling of relief,
on arriving at their destination and inquiring what
there is to be seen, that there is nothing in particular,
and the sub-Alpine walker has this charm perpetually
with him. His expedition cannot fail, for it does not
aim at any particular object on the attainment of which
it depends whether he considers himself successful or
not. These sub-Alpine walks and rambles form the background,
the setting, the frame, and the surrounding
<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>of the more sharply defined and more memorable
high expeditions. Perhaps these are but the sentiments
of advancing mountaineering age; certainly
they may be heard most often from those who
have reached that period of life when they no longer
pay heed to wrinkles in their trousers, when they are
somewhat exacting in the matter of club dinners, and
when they object strongly to receiving assistance from
younger folk in putting on their overcoats. Howbeit,
as we may recall the statement made in the
<q>Delectus,</q>—
</p>
    <lg>
<l rend='margin-left: 10'>Neque semper arcum</l>
<l>Tendit Apollo,</l>
</lg>
    <p>even so does the mountaineer occasionally relax his
muscles, and find pleasure in the Alpine midlands.
Moreover, the writer feels that the perpetual breathing
of rarefied air may be apt to induce too great a strain
on his readers, and recollects that a piano always
tuned to concert pitch is not so harmonious an instrument
as one occasionally unstrung; so some relief
is at times necessary. Contrast, inasmuch as nature
provides it on every hand, we may be sure is a thing
for which man has an instinctive craving; and to my
mind, at least, a picture in which rich colouring is
introduced, and where the result of the blending is
harmonious, is more satisfactory than the work which
appeals by what I believe artists would call <q>tone.</q>
The principle applies rather widely. We may have
<pb n='241'/><anchor id='Pg241'/>observed that young ladies of prepossessing appearance
love to be accompanied by dogs of repulsive
mien. The costermonger, again, if possessed, as he
always is, of a hoarse voice, is not completely equipped
unless provided with a boy companion capable of
sending forth in alternate measure the shrillest cries
which the human larynx is capable of emitting.
Thus may the pair better vaunt their wares, compel
attention, and attract notice. The same objects, at
any rate the latter two, influence an author, and not
only in all cases, it would seem, when he is actually
engaged in writing. So our expeditions, now to be
described, may be looked upon as material for contrast,
and may be skipped if thought fit—at any rate
by purchasers—without risk of wounding the writer’s
feelings.

<note place="margin">The <q>High Level Route</q></note>

<p>
Some years ago we were travelling over that district
of the Alps which to the true lover of mountain
scenery can never become hackneyed—that is, the
stretch of glacier land between Chamouni and Zermatt,
first made known by Messrs. Foster, Jacomb,
Winkfield, and others, and known to mountaineers as
the <q>high-level route.</q> We had reached Monvoisin, then,
possibly still, one of the cosiest and most comfortable
little inns to be found among the mountains. An
immense variety of first-rate glacier passes of moderate
difficulty lie between this Val de Bagne and the Arolla
valley; the Col de la Serpentine, the Col Gétroz, the
<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>Col de Breney, the Col Chermontane, and others, all
of high interest and varied scenery, tempt the walker
according to his powers. We selected on this occasion
the Col du Mont Rouge, having a design on the bold
little peak towering just above the Col, and known as
the Ruinette. This peak, it may be at once mentioned,
was ascended for the first time in 1865 by Mr. Edward
Whymper, a mountaineer who has never ceased happily
to add to his spoils and trophies since in all parts of
the globe, and who, unlike most of the clan, has kept
in the front rank from the day he first climbed an
Alpine slope.
</p>
<note place="margin">A prescription for ill-humour</note>
<p>
We arrived soaked through, and with deplorably
short tempers, at the hotel at Monvoisin. Now tobacco
has been vaunted as a palliative to persons
in this emotional state. Liquid remedies, described
by the vulgar-minded as <q>a drop of something
short,</q> or, more tersely, <q>a wet,</q> have been recommended
as tending to induce a healthier state
of mind. But there is one specific remedy which
never fails, and to this by tacit consent we at once
resorted.
</p>

<p>
Even as one touch of nature has been stated, on
reliable authority, to make the whole world kin, so
may one touch of a lucifer match, if discreetly applied
beneath well-seasoned logs, induce even in the most
irritable and wearied individual a change of feeling
and a calm contentment. As the logs crackled and
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>spluttered, hissing like angry cats, so did the prescription
purge away, if not the evil humours, at any rate
the ill-humour engendered by sore feet and damp
raiment, till it vanished with the smoke up the
chimney. As a matter of actual fact, however, it
ought to be stated that the greater part of the smoke at
first made its way into the room. Before long, assisted
by a passable dinner, which acts on such conditions of
mind as do the remedies known to the learned in
medicine as <q>derivatives,</q> we waxed monstrous merry.
We laughed heartily at our own jokes, and with almost
equal fervour at those of other people—a very creditable
state of feeling, as any who have associated much
with facetiously disposed folk will be ready to acknowledge.
As the evening wore on, and the fire burnt
lower, we became more silent and thoughtful, watching
the pale blue and green tongues of flame licking round
the charred logs. There is a pleasure, too, in this
state. No one felt disposed to break the charm of
thoughtfulness in the company by throwing on fresh
fuel. The fire had done its work, had helped matters
on, had left things a little better than it found them—an
epitome of a good and useful life. The embers fell
together at last, throwing up but a few short-lived
sparks; nothing remained but the recollection of what
had been once so bright, and a heap of ashes—a fit
emblem; for one of the party who was the life and
soul of the expedition can never again join in body
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>with us in the Alps, or revisit those Alpine midlands
he loved so keenly. We rose from our seats
and threw back the curtains from the window. The
mists had vanished, and with them all doubt and all
uncertainty, while the stream of light from the full
moon seemed a promise of peace and rest from elsewhere.
</p>

<note place="margin">A meditation on grass slopes</note>

<p>
At an early period of a walk there is always the
greatest objection to putting forth exertion, the result
of which has almost immediately to be undone. That
man is indeed robust, and possessed of three times
the ordinary amount of brass, if he fails not to find
it distasteful to walk up a hill at the end of an
expedition, or down one at the commencement.
The drawback to the commanding position of the
hotel at Monvoisin lies in the fact that it is absolutely
necessary to descend the hill to begin with,
which always seems a sinful waste of energy, seeing
that the grass slopes opposite, which are steep,
have immediately afterwards to be climbed. The
natural grass steps looked inviting, but in the language
of the Portuguese dialogue book we found them
all either <q>too long or much short.</q> One ascent over
a grass slope is very much like another, and description
in detail would be as wearisome as the slopes
themselves often prove. Yet it is worthy of notice
that there is an art to be acquired even in climbing
grass slopes. We had more than one opportunity on
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>the present occasion of seeing that persons look
supremely ridiculous if they stumble about, and we
noticed also that, like a bowler when he has delivered
a long hop to the off for the third time in one over,
the stumbler invariably inspects the nails in his
boots, a proceeding which deceives no one. It is quite
easy to judge of a man’s real mountaineering capacity
by the way in which he attacks a steep grass
slope. The unskilful person, who fancies himself perfectly
at home amongst the intricacies of an ice-fall,
will often candidly admit that he never can walk with
well-balanced equilibrium on grass, a form of vegetable
which, it might be thought in many instances
of self-sufficient mountaineers, would naturally suit
them. There is often real danger in such places,
and not infrequently the wise man will demand the
use of the rope, especially when there are any tired
members among the party. There is no better way
of learning how to preserve a proper balance on a
slope than by practising on declivities of moderate
steepness, and it is astonishing to find how often
those who think they have little to learn, or, still
worse, believe that there is nothing to learn, will find
themselves in difficulties on a mountain-side, and
forced to realise that they have got themselves into
a rather humiliating position. We may have seen
before now, all of us, distinguished cragsmen to
whom an ascent of the Weisshorn or Matterhorn
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>was but a mere stroll, utterly pounded in botanical
expeditions after Edelweiss, and compelled to regain a
position of security by very ungraceful sprawls, or,
worse still, have to resort to the unpardonable alternative
of asking for assistance. It is on such places that
the skill born of constant practice is best shown in the
peasant as contrasted with the amateur; but the latter
could easily acquire the art, were he not, as a rule, too
high and mighty to do so. It is a great point, too, if the
expedition is to be thoroughly enjoyed, to transport
one’s self over the earlier part of the day’s climb with
the least possible amount of exertion. The art possibly
resembles that which, I am told, is acquired by those
of ill-regulated minds, whom the force of circumstances
and the interests of society compel to exercise themselves
for a certain number of hours daily in that
form of unproductive labour exemplified in the
machine known as the treadmill. No doubt the very
ardent mountaineer might find that facilities would
be accorded to him during such time as he cannot
visit the Alps of practising this art in the manner
indicated.
</p>

<note place="margin">The agile person’s vagaries</note>

<p>
Before long, the smooth unbroken snow slope leading
up to the Col du Mont Rouge, glistening like a
sheet of amber-coloured satin in the light of early
dawn, came into sight. One of the party, who had complained
throughout of the slow pace at which he had
been going, and who was already far ahead, now went
<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>through a singular performance. Conceiving that
he would stimulate us to greater exertion by displaying
his own agility, he suddenly shot forth, as
an arrow from the bow, and ran at great speed on to
the snow slope. But he had misjudged the hardness
of the snow. It fell out, therefore, that after two
or three curious flounders his limbs suddenly shot
out to all points of the compass. A desperate effort
to recall his members under control resulted only in
his suddenly coiling up into a little round ball, like
a spider in a state of nervousness, and in that
shape descending with considerable momentum, and
not a few bumps, down the slope over some knobby
stones and on to a fortunately placed little grass
ledge. When we joined him a few minutes later, he
observed unblushingly that he had found a capital
place for breakfast. So have I seen a skater, after
performing a few exercises of a somewhat violent
nature, resembling the dances performed by nigger
minstrels wearing excessively long boots, suddenly sit
down and instantly adjust a perfectly correctly
applied strap. On resuming our journey the agile
member was firmly secured with a rope, for fear, as
we told him, that he should become possessed with
a sudden idea to hunt for a suitable place for
luncheon by resorting to his previous tactics. Somewhat
crestfallen, he took a place in the rear of the
caravan, and condescended to make use of the little
<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>notches scraped out by the leader in the hard
snow.
</p>

<note place="margin">Ascent of the Ruinette</note>

<p>
A few minutes later the full sunlight of early
morning burst upon us, and produced, as it always
does on such occasions, a feeling of supreme contempt
for those slothful individuals who had not got up
as early as we had. This moment of exhilaration
is often the very best of a whole expedition, and is
apt to lead, I know not why, to an ebullition of
feeling, which usually takes the form of horse-play
and practical joking. A series of gentle slopes led us
up to the Col. Our ascent took us gradually round the
base of the Ruinette, and we cast anxious glances to
our right to see if any practicable line of rocks could
be made out. The mountain is tolerably steep from
this side, but the rocks are broken and were bare of
snow. On the summit of the Col the party divided, the
agile person and some of the others deciding that they
would go straight on to Arolla, while Burgener and I
bespoke the services of the porter, and made straight
for the long buttress of rock running down almost
directly to the Col on the north-west face of the
mountain. Half an hour’s complicated scrambling
resulted in our attaining a little level plateau of
rock on the ridge. As we looked down on to the
great snow-field from which the Gétroz glacier takes
its origin, we perceived, far away, the forms of our
companions looking like a flight of driven grouse
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>about a quarter of a minute after the sportsman has
missed them with both barrels. No doubt they were
enjoying themselves thoroughly, but from our point of
view the sight of some four or five individuals walking
along at ten-foot intervals with bowed heads and
plodding gait did not suggest any very consummate
pleasure. Rejoicing, therefore, that they were making
nice tracks for us to follow later in the day, we turned
again to the rocks above. Following always the ridge,
we clambered straight up, and found opportunities
for very pretty gymnastics (that is, from our own
point of view) on this part of the mountain. Our
object was to select rocks that would give good practice
in climbing, rather than to pick out the easiest
possible line, and as a result we got into more than
one difficult place, difficult enough at any rate to
demand much conversation on the part of the guides.
In about three hours from the Col we found ourselves
looking over the arête on to the southern side of the
mountain with a very compact and varied view in all
directions. Close by, the long ridge of the Serpentine
formed a fine foreground, and a wide expanse of
glacier district made up a tolerably wild panorama.
A few minutes’ climbing along the crest landed us
above a deep notch filled in with soft snow. Into
this we plunged, and in another minute or two
stood on the summit of the Ruinette. So far as we
knew at the time, the mountain had not previously
<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/>been ascended from the northern side, and, indeed,
the peak does not appear to be visited nearly so often
as it deserves. Following for the most part the
same line as that taken during the ascent, we regained,
in about a couple of hours, the Col. Here
we hunted diligently, seeking what we might devour,
and feeling sure that our friends would have left us
something as a reward for our energy. It transpired,
however, subsequently, that the agile person’s exertions
had provoked in him such an appetite that there
was little if anything to leave, so we followed the
tracks laid out in the snow, noticing with some
concern that one member of the previous party had
sunk at every step some eighteen inches deeper into
the soft compound than anybody else. By the marks
on the snow we perceived, also, that he had trailed
his axe along by his side, a sure sign of weariness.
By sunset we had gained the Pas de Chévres, and ran
gaily down the gentle slope towards the hotel. A
little distance from the building we came so suddenly
upon a manly form, outstretched, like a stranded
star-fish, on a mossy bank, that we almost leaped upon
his stomach. Yet he moved not, and was apparently
wrapped in slumber. We stopped and crept cautiously
up to survey him more closely. It was the agile
person.

<note place="margin">Saas in the olden days</note>
<p>
In the old days of mountaineering, Saas was a
place more often talked about than visited. The
beauty of the scenery around was indeed unquestionable,
the number of expeditions of every degree of difficulty
seemed almost without limit, first-rate guides
could be obtained with ease, and yet there was never
any difficulty in finding quarters in the hotels. In
ascending the main valley from Visp the great stream
of travellers divided at Stalden into a large stream
that made its way to Zermatt and a little rivulet that
meandered along the much finer valley towards Saas
and the Mattmark. It thus fell out that, notwithstanding
a small body of indefatigable mountaineers
had explored the higher peaks and passes on both
sides of the valley with tolerable completeness, there
was left a considerable number of smaller expeditions
capable of providing good amusement for the climber
desirous of acquiring fame or of exploring the less
known districts. In these days, when the soaring
ambition of mountaineers has led them to climb
heights far greater than any found in the Alps, an
account of an expedition of an unimportant peak may
seem out of place. Indeed, its details were so devoid
of sensational incident that the recital may be dull;
but, as will appear directly, that is not the writer’s
<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>fault; at any rate, he ventures to give it, for the same
reason that invariably prompts youthful authors to
write unnecessary books; that is, as they say in their
preface, to supply a want long felt—a want, it may
be stated, usually felt in their own pockets and nowhere
else.
</p>

<p>
With every respect to the older generation
of mountaineers, they are much to blame in one
matter. The stock of Alpine jokes is scanty; indeed,
a well-read author can get them all, with a little arrangement,
into the compass of one short description
of a day in the mountains. Again, the number of
Alpine subjects lending themselves to facetiousness is
but small. The supply has been proved beyond
question entirely inadequate to meet the demand, but
former writers have recklessly drawn on this limited
stock and entirely exhausted the topics, if not the
readers. Some allowance may therefore be made
when the position is considered, and it is realised that
the writer is endeavouring to patch together a fabric
with materials almost too threadbare for use, and that
he is compelled wholly to pass by such attractive topics
as the early start and consequent ill-temper, the dirty
porter, the bergschrund, the use of tobacco, or the
flea. The last-mentioned beast is in fact now universally
prohibited from intrusion into polite Alpine
literature; he has had his day. But why? he has
surely some right to the place. An eminent French
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>composer<note place="foot">Hector Berlioz.</note> has written a ballad in his honour; but
though, as old Hans Andersen wrote, he was much
thought of at one time, and occupied a high position,
seeing that he was in the habit of mixing with the
human race, and might even have royal blood in his
veins, yet he is now deposed. I cannot forbear from
paying a last tribute to the memory of a departing,
though formerly constant, companion. To find oneself
obliged to cut the acquaintance of a friend whom I have
fed with my own hand must give rise to some qualms.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, too, the older writings are too well
known of many to be dished up again in altered form,
like a Sunday dinner in the suburbs; so that even
the most common form of originality, videlicet, forgetfulness
of the source from which you are borrowing,
is forbidden. Plagiarism is a crime that seldom is
allowed to pass undetected. There are many people
in this world possessed of such a small amount of
originality themselves, that they spend their whole
time in searching for the want of that quality in
others. The human inhabitants of the ark, unless
they made the most of their unexampled opportunities
for the study of natural history, must have become
desperately bored with each other, and no doubt,
when set free, said all the good things, each in their
own independent nucleus of commencing society, which
they had heard while immured. On the whole, it is
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>fortunate for writers that the period known as the
dark ages came to pass; it allowed those who commenced
their career on this side of the hiatus to make,
on the old lines, a perfectly fresh start.
</p>
<note place="margin">A curious omission</note>
<p>
Perhaps no country in the world has had the
minute topography of its uninhabited districts so
thoroughly worked out as Switzerland. Beyond
question the orography is more accurately given
than anywhere else; in this respect, indeed, no
other country can compare with it. It might seem,
even to those who have studied the matter, almost
impossible to find any corner of the Alps that has not
been described; and the discovery that a few superficial
square yards of Swiss territory, arranged on an
incline, had not been discussed in detail came upon
the writer with somewhat of a shock. It was clearly
somebody’s duty to rectify the omission and fill the
gap; whether the expedition was of importance from
any point of view, or whether any one in the wide
world had the smallest desire to read a description of
it, was a matter of no moment whatever. There was
a vacuum, and it was a thing abhorrent. The mountain,
to which reference is made above, lies east of
Saas, and is known to such of the inhabitants as have
any knowledge of geography as the Portienhorn.
Substantially this peak is the highest point of a long
rocky ridge running north and south, and called the
Portien Grat.
</p>

<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>

<note place="margin">The chef’s masterpiece</note>

<p>
One fine evening we sat outside the inn at Saas
just before dinner, seriously discussing the prospect
of climbing this mountain. The guides were of
opinion that we ought to sleep out, and surmised
that the rocks might be found much more difficult
than they looked. With some reluctance on our part
<anchor id="corr255"/><corr sic="thier">their</corr> views were allowed to prevail on the point, and
they started off in triumph, promising to return and
report when all the necessary preparations for starting
should be completed, while we went in to prepare ourselves
for the next day by an early dinner. The inn
in those days was somewhat rude, and the cuisine was
not remarkable save for the extraordinary faculty
possessed by the chef for cooking anything that happened
to come in his way, and reducing it all to the
same level of tastelessness. On the present occasion,
however, stimulated, no doubt, by certain critical
rebukes, he had determined to surpass himself.
Towards the end of the repast, as we sat chewing
some little wooden toothpicks, which were found to
have more flavour than anything else placed on the
table, we heard the chef cross the yard and go into
a certain little outhouse. A few minutes later a
subtle and delicate aroma made its way into the
apartment, leading us, after a few interrogative sniffs,
to get up and close the window. Gradually the
savour became more pronounced, and one of the party
gave expression to his opinion that there was now
<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>satisfactory proof of the accuracy of his constant
statement that the drains were out of order. Gradually
intensifying, the savour assumed the decided
character of a smell, and we looked out of window
to see in which direction the cemetery lay. Stronger
and stronger grew the perception as steps came
mounting up the stairs; the door opened, and all
doubt was set at rest as the chef entered, bearing
proudly a large cheese. In a moment, to his dismay,
he was left undisputed master of the apartment.
</p>
<note place="margin">An evicted family</note>
<p>
We left Saas equipped as for a serious expedition.
A stout rustic, who was the most preternaturally ugly
man I ever saw, led the way; he had a very large
mouth and an odd-shaped face, so that he resembled
a frog with a skewer wedged across inside his cheeks.
On his back he bore a bag full of very spiky straw,
which the guides said was a mattress. In about an
hour’s time we arrived at a carelessly built chalet on
the Almagel Alp, of which the outside was repulsive
and the inside revolting. But the experienced mountaineer,
on such occasions, is not easily put out, and
exhibits very little astonishment at anything he may
see, and none at anything that he may smell. The
hut consisted of a single apartment, furnished with a
fireplace and a bed. The fireplace was situated in
the centre of the room; the couch was separated by
a dilapidated hoarding from a shed tenanted by a
cow of insatiable appetite—indeed, it may have been
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>originally designed as a manger. The bed, which
accommodated apparently the family of the tenant,
was found on actual measurement to be forty-eight
inches in length and twenty in width; nevertheless
the two guides packed themselves into it, adopting in
their recumbent position the theory that if you keep
your head and your feet warm you are all right. By
the flickering gleams of firelight it could be perceived
through the smoke that these were the only portions
of their frames actually in the bed owing to its excessive
shortness; but guides share, with babies in
perambulators, a happy faculty of being able to sleep
peacefully whatever be the position of their heads.
The dispossessed family of the tenant would not
submit, notwithstanding strong remarks, to summary
eviction, and watched our proceedings with much
interest. It was pointed out to them that curiosity
was a vicious quality, that it had been defined as
looking over other people’s affairs and overlooking
one’s own, and that, on the whole, they had better
retire, which they did reluctantly, to a little shed in
which was a large copper pot with other cheese-making
accessories. Apparently they spent the night in
scouring the copper pot.
</p>

<p>
The mattress proved to be so tightly packed that
it was easier, on the whole, to lie awake under it than
to sleep on the top of it, and less painful. About
4 <hi rend='small'>A.M.</hi> one of the guides incautiously moved his head,
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>and having thus disturbed his equilibrium fell heavily
on to the floor. Thereupon he woke up and said it
was time to start. We bade a cheerful adieu to our
host, who was obtaining such repose as could be got
by the process of leaning against the doorpost, and
made our way upwards.
</p>

<p>
On the south side of the Portienhorn a long and
rough rocky ridge, preserving a tolerably uniform
height, extends as far as the Sonnighorn. Ultimately
the ridge, still running in a southerly direction,
curves slightly round to the west up to the
Monte Moro, and thus forms the head of the Saas
valley. There are several unimportant peaks in this
ridge perhaps equally worthy, with the Portienhorn,
of a place in literature; but of all the points south of
the Weissmies this Portienhorn is perhaps the most
considerable, and certainly the most difficult of access.
At any rate, we climbed the peak, and this is how we
did it.
</p>

<note place="margin">A short cut after a knife</note>

<p>
It was clear that the southern ridge was more
feasible than the northern one, which drops to a col
known as the Zwischbergen Pass, and then rises
again to merge into the mass of the Weissmies. The
whole of the western slope of the Portienhorn is
covered by the Rothblatt Glacier, the ice of which is
plastered up against its sides. We kept to the left of
the termination of this glacier, and after a brief look
round turned our steps away from the rock buttress
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>forming the northern boundary of the glacier, though
we were of opinion that we might by this line ascend
the mountain; but we nevertheless selected the southern
ridge, on the same principle that the sportsman,
perfectly capable of flying across any obstacle, however
high, sometimes, out of consideration no doubt for his
horse, elects to follow somebody else through a gap.
In good time we reached a point about halfway up
the side of the mountain, and halted at the upper
edge of a sloping patch of snow. It was fortunate
that we had ample time to spare, for considerable
delay was experienced here. Burgener had become
newly possessed of a remarkable knife, which he was
perpetually taking out of his pocket and admiring
fondly; in fact, it provided material for conversation
to the guides for the whole day. The knife was an
intricate article, and strikingly useless, being weak in
the joints; but nevertheless Burgener was vastly
proud of the weapon, and valued it as much as an
ugly man does a compliment. In the middle of
breakfast the treasure suddenly slipped out of his
hand, and started off down the slope. With a yell of
anguish he bounded off after it, and went down the
rocks in a manner and at a pace that only a guide in
a state of excitement can exhibit. The incident was
trivial, but it impressed on me the extraordinary
powers of sure-footedness and quickness on rocks that
a good guide possesses. An amateur might have
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>climbed after these men the whole day, and have
thought that he was nearly as good as they, but he
could no more have gone down a couple of hundred
feet as this guide did without committing suicide,
than he could have performed a double-three backwards
the first time he put on skates. He might, indeed, have
gone backwards, but he would not have achieved his
double-three. Turning northwards the moment we
were on the arête, we made our way, with a good deal
of scrambling, upwards. The rocks were firm and
good, and, being dry, gave no great difficulty. Still
they were far from easy, and now and again there
were short passages sufficiently troublesome to yield
the needed charm to a mountain climb, difficult
enough at any rate to make us leave our axes behind
and move one at a time. But how have the times
altered since our expedition was made! Nowadays
such a climb would be more fitly mentioned casually
after dinner as <q>a nice little walk before church,</q> <q>a
capital after-breakfast scramble,</q> <q>a stroll strongly recommended
to persons of an obese habit,</q> and so forth.
Nevertheless, there is a very distinct pleasure in
climbing up a peak of this sort—greater, perhaps, than
may be found on many of the more highly rated,
formidable, and, if the truth be told, fashionable
mountains; for the expedition was throughout interesting,
and the contrast between the view to the west
where the Mischabelhörner reared up their massive
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>forms, and to the east looking towards Domo d’Ossola
and the Italian lake district, was one to repay a
climber who has eyes as well as limbs. The crest
was in places tolerably sharp, and we were forced at
times to adopt the expedient, conventionally supposed
to be the only safe one in such cases, of bestriding
the rock edge. It should be stated, however, that,
as usual on such occasions, when we desired to progress
we discarded this position, and made our way
onwards in the graceful attitude observed at the seaside
in those who are hunting on the sand for marine
specimens. And thus we arrived ultimately at the
top, where we gave way to a properly regulated amount
of subdued enthusiasm, proportionate to the difficulty
and height of the vanquished mountain. No trace of
previous travellers could be found on the summit. It
was a maiden ascent. Doubtless the mythical and
ubiquitous chamois-hunter had been up before us, for
at the time I write of the district was noted for
chamois; but even if he had, it makes no difference.
We have found it long since necessary to look upon
ascents stated to have been made by chamois-hunters
as counting for nothing, and in the dearth of new peaks
in the Alps, have to resort to strange devices and
strained ideas for novelty. Thus, a mountain in the
present day can be the means of bringing glory and
honour to many climbers. For instance:—

<p>
Many more might be added; probably in the
future many more will, for, in modern mountaineering
phrase, the Portienhorn <q>goes all over.</q> By 4 <hi rend='small'>P.M.</hi>
we were back again in the Saas valley.
</p>

<p>
It seems, as I write, only yesterday that all this
happened. But a regular revolution has really taken
place. There can be no question, I think, that fewer
real mountaineers are to be found in the old <q>playground</q>
than formerly. Still, there are not wanting
climbers, all of them apparently of the first rank.
For among the high Alps now, even as on the dramatic
stage of to-day, there are no amateurs.
</p>

<note place="margin">The amateur</note>

<p>
A curious human fungus that has grown up
<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>suddenly of late is the emancipated schoolboy spoken
of by a certain, principally feminine, clique of admirers
as <q>such a wonderful actor, you know.</q> Very learned
is he in the technicalities of the stage. The perspiring
audience in the main drawing-room he alludes to as
<q>those in front.</q> He knows what <q>battens</q> are, and
<q>flies,</q> and <q>tormentors,</q> and <q>spider-traps.</q> He endeavours
to imitate well-known actors, but does not
imitate the laborious process by which these same
artists arrive at successful results. But we all know
him, and are aware also, at any rate by report, of his
overweening vanity, and the manner in which he
intrudes his conception of <q>Hamlet</q> or <q>Richelieu</q>
on a longsuffering public. Without the slightest
knowledge technically of how to walk, talk, sit down,
go off, or come on, he rushes on the boards possessed
solely of such qualifications for his task as may arise
in a brain fermenting with conceit. Critics he regards
as persons existing solely for the purpose of crushing
him, and showing ill-tempered hostility born of envy.
The judicious, if they accept and weakly avail themselves
of orders, can but grieve and marvel that there
should exist that curious state of folly which prompts
a man to exhibit it before the world, or even to thrust
it upon his fellow-creatures. Some men are born
foolish—a pity, no doubt, but the circumstances are
beyond their own control; some achieve a reputation
for lack of wisdom, and even make it pay; but some
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>thrust their folly on others, and to such no quarter
need be given. The self-constituted exponent of a
most difficult art is not a whit more ridiculous than
the boy or man who rushes at a difficult peak before
he has learnt the elements of mountaineering science.
A man may become a good amateur actor if he will
consent to devote his leisure to ascertaining what
there is to learn, and trying to learn it; and a man
may become a good mountaineer by adopting the
same line of action. But this is rarely the case. Too
often they forget that, as a late president of the
Alpine Club remarked, <q>life is a great opportunity,
not to be thrown away lightly.</q> It is said sometimes
by unreflecting persons that such institutions as the
Alpine Club are responsible for the misfortunes and
calamities that have arisen from time to time, and
may still arise. But there has been a good example
set if recruits would only turn to it; for the mountaineers
in the old style, speaking of a generation
that climbs but little in these days, did what it is
the fashion now to call their <q>work</q> thoroughly—too
thoroughly and completely, perhaps, to please altogether
their successors. Novelty in the mountains of Switzerland
may be exhausted, but there are still too
many expeditions of which, because they have been
done once or twice, the danger is not adequately
recognised. If these remarks, written in no captious
spirit, but rather with the strongest desire to lay
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>stress on truths that are too often ignored, should
lead any aspiring but unpractised mountaineer to
pause and reflect before he tries something beyond
his strength and capabilities, some little good will at
least have been done. It is not that the rules are
unknown; they are simple, short, ready to hand, and
intelligible; but the penalty that may be exacted for
breaking any of them is a terribly heavy one—<hi rend='italic'>absit

<p>
A fair critic—in the matter of sex—discussing a
recently published work with the author, remarked
that it was the most charming book she had ever
read. <q>I was told it would not interest me,</q> she
remarked most seriously to him, <q>but really I found
it delightful: there are such lovely wide margins to
the pages, you know.</q> On much the same principle a
highly intelligent lady, noted for her theatrical discrimination,
once remarked that she liked those
theatres best which afforded the longest entr’actes.
So in the Alps we felt from time to time the necessity,
between the more stirring episodes resulting from
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>higher mountaineering, to interpose minor expeditions,
on which no less care and thought was often lavished
to make them worthy of pursuit. These were our
entr’actes. Of such expeditions it is customary to say
that they are the most enjoyable of any undertaken.
Without going so far as this, it may be conceded that
they have a pleasure of their own, and it is at least
no more difficult to discover a novel form of sub-Alpine
expedition than to vary the details of a big
climb. One of these episodes, undertaken while we
were barred from the higher mountains by a fall
of snow, consisted in a night attack on the Mont
Buet.
</p>

<note place="margin">Mont Buet</note>

<p>
Now the Mont Buet, although it lies close to the
regular highway to Chamouni from the Rhone valley,
is a peak but rarely even seen of the ordinary tourist;
and, considering the numbers of our countrymen
that flock to the village whence they imagine that
they see the summit of Mont Blanc, the English folk
who make the ascent are strangely few. Yet the walk
is not a laborious one; not more fatiguing, for
example, than the tramp from Martigny to Chamouni
over the Col de Balme on a hot day. Fashion in the
mountains is very conservative, and probably it is too
late in the day now to hope that this mountain will
ever gain all the reputation it deserves, for, though
comparatively unknown, its praises have been by no
means left unsung. Possibly the lowness of the guides’
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>tariff for the peak may have something to do with the
matter, and may serve to explain why it is so much
left out in the cold; for this is a very potent agent
in determining the attractiveness of special localities.
How many go to Chamouni, and never wander along
one of the most beautiful sylvan paths in the Alps,
that leads to the Glacier des Bossons through the
woods, where the view, as the spectator suddenly finds
himself confronted with the huge stream of pure
glacier, topped by a most magnificent ice-fall, and
backed by the crags of the Aiguille du Midi, compares
by no means unfavourably with the more frequently
photographed panorama from the Montanvert. Ask
a dozen persons at haphazard who are staying at
Chamouni where the Mont Buet is, and ten out of the
number will be unable to answer you. But the
pictures hung on the line are not invariably the best
in an exhibition; and the Mont Buet is a masterpiece,
so to speak, <q>skied.</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">We hire carriages</note>

<p>
Our party that summer at Chamouni was a large
one, for we had stayed a long time in the hotel, and
knew, as the phrase goes, a great many to speak to—quite
a different thing to answering for them. We
conceived the plan of so timing our modest expedition
as to arrive on the summit of the Mont Buet about
sunset. It was agreed by some members of the party
that it would be <q>such fun, you know,</q> to come down
in the dark. The inference to be gathered from this
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>is that the party was not exclusively composed of the
male sex. Two of us, reputed to be good at a bargain,
were deputed to charter carriages to convey
the members of the expedition up to Argentière,
where the ascent commenced. The carriages of
Chamouni, though no doubt practical and well suited
to the mountain roads, were not found to be of
uniform excellence. Availing ourselves of a proper
<anchor id="corr269"/><corr sic="in roduction">introduction</corr>, we made the temporary acquaintance
of an individual interested officially in vehicular
traffic, who possessed that remarkable insight into
character noticeable in all who are concerned with
horses, and knew exactly what we wanted without any
preliminary explanation on our part. <q>Voilà votre
affaire,</q> he said, and indicated a machine that would
have been out of date when the first <hi rend='italic'>char-à-banc</hi> was
constructed. We inquired if the somewhat unsavoury
load (it had, apparently, been in recent requisition
for farming purposes) which the cart contained might
be removed, and he said there was no objection to
this. <q>See,</q> said the proprietor, <q>the seats have
backs.</q> <q>But they tip up,</q> we remonstrated. <q>That
is nothing,</q> rejoined the proprietor; <q>they can be tied
down: the carriage is good, and has gone many miles.
However, Monsieur is evidently particular; he shall
be satisfied. Behold!</q> and the proprietor threw
open the creaking door of a shed, and revealed to
our gaze a pretentious landau with faded linings and
<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>wheels which did not seem to be circular. This
<q>machine,</q> he assured us, it would be hard to equal
for locomotive purposes. Two strange beasts were
connected to it, chiefly, as it seemed, by bits of string.
One of the animals was supported on two very puffy
hind legs and two very tremulous fore-legs, and
seemed perpetually on the point of going down on
its knees to supplicate that it might be allowed to go
no further. Its companion was a horse of the most
gloomy nature, that no amount of chastisement could
stir from a despondent and pensive frame of mind.
Both these treasures had a capacity for detecting an
upward incline that was marvellously acute. Then
there was a structure like a magnified perambulator,
of which one wheel was afflicted with a chronic propensity
for squeaking, while the other described a
curious serpentine track as it rolled along. Not
being, however, in any particular hurry, we decided
to avail ourselves of such assistance as these vehicles
might afford, and did, as a matter of fact, ultimately
reach our destination, if not in, at least with them.
</p>

<note place="margin">The incomplete moralist</note>

<p>
From Argentière we followed the familiar track of
the Tête Noire for some little distance, and then bore
away to the left up the valley leading towards the Bérard
Chalet. The party, which had kept well together for
the first few minutes after parting with the carriages,
were soon straggling off in every direction, and the
chief organiser of the expedition, desperately anxious
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>lest some should go astray and be no more found, ran
to and fro from one little group to another, and got
into a highly excitable frame of mind, like a busily
minded little dog when first taken out for a walk.
Chief among the more erratic members was an
elderly person who had, unwisely, been asked to join
the party for no very definite reason, but because
some one had said that it would be obviously incomplete
without him. The old gentleman had no
previous experience of mountain walks, but had very
complete theories on the subject. He had made
great preparations for his day’s climb, had carefully
dieted himself the day previously, and was not a little
proud of his equipment and attire. He was furnished
with a spiked umbrella, a green tin box, and
a particularly thin pair of boots; for he wished to
prove the accuracy of a theory that man, being
descended from the apes, might properly use his feet
as prehensile members, and he held that this additional
aid would prove valuable on rocks. It was currently
reported, notwithstanding his loquacity, that he was
a very wise person, and indeed he dropped hints himself,
which he was much annoyed if we did not take,
on the subject of a projected literary work. We were
given to understand that the publishers were all
hankering after the same, and he had a manner in
conversation of tentatively quoting passages and
watching eagerly for the effects. He was known to
<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>us as the incomplete moralist, and proved to be a
very didactic person.
</p>

<note place="margin">The niece to the moralist</note>

<p>
But this was not all; there was one other member
of the party, who may be described, as in the old-fashioned
list of the <q>Dramatis Personæ,</q> as <q>niece to
the moralist.</q> Somehow or another, she seemed to
lead everything; instinctively all gave way to her
wishes, and even the chief organiser looked to her for
confirmation of his opinions before enunciating them
with decision. Bright, impulsive, wilful, she led the
moralist, subjectively speaking, whither she would, and
he had no chance at all. <q>She ought not to have
come at all on such an expedition,</q> he said, looking at
the light, fragile form ahead; <q>but you know you can’t
persuade a butterfly to take systematic exercise, and
everything seems to give her so much pleasure;</q> and
here the moralist looked rather wistful, and somehow
the artificiality seemed to fade away from him for the
moment. <q>Such of us,</q> he resumed, <q>as stay long
enough in this world cease to have much hopefulness;
and when that quality shows up too strong in the
young, such as that child yonder, somehow I don’t
think they often——</q> Here he paused abruptly, and,
selecting a meat lozenge from a store in his tin box,
put it into his mouth and apparently swallowed it at
once; at any rate, he gulped down something. It
must be allowed that the moralist had done his best
to prevent his charge from accompanying the party.
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>She had been reminded of what learned doctors had
said, that she was not to exert herself; that certain
persons, vaguely alluded to, would be very angry, and
so forth. The moralist had been talked down in two
minutes. He might as well have pointed out to
the little budding leaflets the unwisdom of mistaking
warm days in March for commencing summer; and,
finally, he had surrendered at discretion, fencing himself
in with some stipulations as to warm cloaks,
<q>this once only,</q> and the like, which he knew would
not be attended to. So she came, and her eager
brightness shed a radiance over the most commonplace
objects, and infected the most prosaic of the
party, even a young lady of varied accomplishments,
who distinguished herself later on. After all, if the
flame burned a little more brightly at the expense of
a limited stock of fuel, was there anything to regret?
Tone down such brightness as hers was, and you have
but an uncut diamond, or a plant that may possibly
last a little longer because its blossom, its fruit, and
with them its beauties, have been cut off to preserve
the dull stem to the utmost. Check the natural
characteristics and outflow of such natures, and you
force them to the contemplation of what is painful
and gloomy. You bring them back fully to this
world, and it is their greatest privilege to be but half
in it, and to have eyes blind to the seamy side. The
Alpine rose-glow owes its fascination to the fact that
<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>we know it will soon fade. So is it with these natures.
They are to be envied. We may hold it truth with
him who sings, <q>Better fifty years of Europe than a
cycle of Cathay.</q> But the parallel is not strictly
true: the brightness will not fade, but will be there
to the end, and the streak of sadness running through
it all gives the fascination. So the wit that approaches
nearest to pathos touches us most deeply, and is one
of the rarest of intellectual talents. With what a
thrill of mixed, but yet pleasurable, sensation do we
recall the timely jest of a lost friend. But all this
has nothing to do with a holiday expedition in the
Alps. Still, it must be remembered, we were on a
sentimental journey in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Before long the chief organiser, seizing an opportunity
when most of the stragglers were within earshot,
announced at the top of his voice that luncheon
would be served on certain flat rocks. This had the
immediate effect of uniting our scattered forces. The
first to arrive (the moralist was slow of foot) were
some gallant members of the high mountaineering
fraternity, who throughout the day evinced astounding
activity, and an unwonted desire to carry burdens
on their backs. Secretly they were burning with an
ambition to display their prowess on some <q>mauvais
pas,</q> or glissade, an ambition rewarded later on in a
somewhat remarkable manner. The rock was spread,
the moralist selected a comfortable place, and,
stimu<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>lated by the appearance of the viands, favoured us
with certain extracts.
</p>

<note place="margin">A discourse on gourmets</note>

<p>
<q>There are many,</q> he observed, holding a large
piece of pie to his mouth and eyeing it to select an
appropriate place for the next bite, <q>who hold that
the sense of taste is not one to which we should much
minister. I do not hold with such;</q> and here he
found the right spot, and for a minute or two the
thread of his discourse was broken off. <q>The painter
blends colours to please the sense of sight; the
musician studies harmonies of sound to please the
ear; each appeals to but one of our imperfect senses,
and yet we think much of them for so doing; we
compliment them, and give them the appellation of
artists. Now the worthy person who dexterously
compounded this article, of which, alas! I hold now
but little in my hand, appeals not to a single but to
a twofold sense; he ministers alike to taste and to
smell, and I must own, after a toilsome walk, with
commendable results. He is an artist in the highest
sense of the word; his merits, to my thinking, are
but inadequately recognised in this world. I am convinced
that they will be more so in another. The
gourmet’s paradise shall provide for him a cherubic
state of existence; then shall he have all the pleasure
that the palate can afford without any ill-omened
presage of subsequent discomfort; for, thrice happy
that he will be, digestion will be an anatomical
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>impossibility.</q> It may be remarked parenthetically
that the possession of a gigantic brain had not
obviated, in the case of the moralist, the deleterious
effects of sour wine. But the moralist was not, as yet,
much of a cherub.
</p>

<p>
As the speaker showed unmistakable signs of
continuing his discourse, which had been chiefly
directed at a youth of whom we only knew that he
was some one’s brother, if the opportunity were
afforded, a sudden and general move was made, and
the proposal that a short adjournment should take
place previous to resuming our upward journey found
instant favour. The chief organiser was by common
consent left to pack up. Straightway the ladies all
produced little sketch-books, and fell very vigorously
to recording their impressions of the scenery around;
whilst the moralist, already somewhat stiff, wandered
from one group to the other and favoured them with
his suggestions. The result of half an hour’s work
with pencil and brush was to produce diagrams of
certain objects which looked uncommonly like telegraph
poles with cross bars attached, but which were
coloured of a vivid green, and were thus obviously
intended for fir trees. The moralist, not finding that
his remarks were met with much favour by the artists,
selected an ascetic who sat apart from the others, and
delivered his next discourse into his inattentive but
uncomplaining ear.
</p>

<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>

<note place="margin">An artistic interlude</note>

<p>
<q>It seems strange to me,</q> he remarked, <q>that those
who are wholly unable to depict, even in the most
elementary manner, the commonplace objects around
them, are for ever seen in the Alps striving after the
most impossible art problems. If so great a stimulus
is needed, a poor result may be confidently anticipated.</q>
(Here the moralist made a fourth attempt to
light a very curious native cigar.) <q>If it takes the
sight of Nature in her sublimest phase, as seen in the
Alps, to stimulate our friends here to show their art,
why, then they haven’t much of it. A milestone
should be sufficient for the purpose, but it seems that
they require a Matterhorn; and it may be gathered,
from what I have heard you and your companions
say, that what is true of Alpine art is true also of
Alpine climbing, and that the <hi rend='italic'>dilettanti</hi> will never take
the trouble to learn how much there is to learn. Our
friends here try to paint a glacier, and have not the
most elementary idea of its anatomy. They represent
vast panoramas, and know nothing of distance;
they——</q> But here the moralist, in the excitement of
his discourse, turned a little white, probably from the
depth of his feelings; and, throwing away his cigar,
walked off alone, and was discovered shortly after
perspiring a good deal, and crumpled up in a somewhat
limp and helpless state.
</p>

<p>
The books were packed up, for the sun was setting
low, and the party wended their way up the steep
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>grass slope till the first great dome of the Mont Buet
came well into sight. Far ahead was the niece,
seemingly unconscious of the effects that the exertion
of climbing told on her slight frame. She was apparently
unaware of any companions around, though
watchful eyes and strong hands were always near lest
any mischance should befall. She spoke to no one.
Nature absorbed all her faculties as she went on with
cheeks rather flushed, and bright, dilated eyes drinking
in every object and every point of beauty. As an
artist in the exercise of his craft makes the outside
world acquainted with beauties ever present to his
eyes, so did the effect on her of the wondrous lights
and shades and colours around call up new thoughts
and reveal fresh marvels in the panorama to others,
though well acquainted with such Alpine scenes.
The spell caught one after another, till the whole
party, all held by the same unsuspected fascination,
walked silently on, while the majestic splendour
around inspired an awe in the mind that even those
most familiar with the marvels of nature in the
mountains had never felt before. The mere recognition
of the fact that the same thought or emotion
is passing simultaneously through the minds of many
is in itself so striking, that the impression so caused
will not ever be effaced from the mind. A crowded
hall is waiting for the advent of the orator of the
occasion, and there enters an old man whose name
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>and work were familiar to all. Instantly, and as if
by magic, all present rose to their feet in token of
respect. No word was spoken, no signal given. The
matter may seem slight, but the scene was one that
those present will never forget. The most hideous
part of the punishment in the old days to the criminal
must have been the moment when, as he stepped
through the last door, the sea of faces below him
upturned simultaneously with a howl of execration.
And all these thoughts were called up by the fact that
one consumptive girl was a member of our mountain
party. Well, such was the case, and it made the
expedition different in many ways from any that we
had ever undertaken, but not perhaps the less worthy
of remembrance.
</p>

<note place="margin">We become thoughtful</note>

<p>
<q>It looks a long way off,</q> observed the moralist,
gazing despondently upwards. <q>Do you say that the
object of our expedition is to climb up to that eminence
yonder? I fear lest some of the weaker
members of the party should fail.</q> (The moralist was
now the penultimate member of the party, the absolute
rear being brought up by one of the guides, who was
pushing him up with the head of his axe. The youth
to whom he was in the habit of addressing his
discourses had in a revengeful mood offered similar
assistance; but the youth wore such a saturnine look
when he made the suggestion, that it was declined
hastily with thanks.) <q>I think that if I took a little
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>wine</q>—here he took all that was left—<q>this feeling of
disinclination to move might conceivably pass off, and
I could then encourage some of the others on what is
clearly to them an arduous expedition. Ah me! but
these little stones are excessively sharp to the feet;
let us turn off on to the snow. I have heard that it is
possible to walk uphill on such a medium, and yet
scarce recognise the fact.</q> By this time most of the
party were well on to the first summit, and the glories
of the sunset, from a point of view which it would be
hard to match in all the mountains, were beginning to
display themselves to the full. The higher we ascended
the more did the eternal mass of white snow on the
other side of the valley develop and tower above us.
Two or three of the more active members were
floundering in the deep snow along the ridge uniting
the two summits, and finding it, if the truth be told,
no small matter to keep pace with the niece, who
skimmed lightly over the surface. Gallantry and the
desire to keep up their reputation forbade that they
should fall to the rear, or allow the rope to tighten
unduly; but their superior mountaineering experience
seemed not a little in danger of being counterbalanced
by their superior weight. All over the rocks on the
Sixt side a thin grey veil of mist seemed to hang,
making the cliffs appear still more vertical than nature
had moulded them, and tinting the crags at the same
time with a deep purple colour.

<note place="margin">A vision on the summit</note>
<p>
In the foreground, looking south, the long jagged
line of the Aiguilles Rouges cut off the view into the
Chamouni valley, and threw up still higher and more
into relief the minor peaks of the Mont Blanc chain.
We huddled together on the summit, while there
seemed hardly time to turn to all points of the
compass to survey the effects. The emotional members
of the party came out strong, and the young
lady of varied accomplishments, who was adjudged by
the others to be of poetic temperament, as she was
fond of alluding rather vaguely to unknown Italian
geniuses, burst forth into ecstasies. However, one or
two of us had rather lost faith in her historical knowledge
and her profound acquaintance with mediæval
art on hearing her discourse learnedly to the vacuous
youth on Savonarola as an artist of great repute, and
on discovering that in the family circle she was held
in submission by an Italianised English governess—discreetly
left at the hotel. A formidable person,
this preceptress, of austere demeanour, with a dyspeptic
habit, highly pomatumed ringlets, and evangelistic
tendencies—a triple combination not infrequently
met with. Still, no one paid any attention to
the accomplished young lady, for an object in the foreground
of the great picture riveted the gaze of most
of us. The niece had advanced a few steps from the
rest of the party, and stood a little apart on the
summit ridge of the mountain, her slight form
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>brought out in strong relief against the many-tinted
sky. The folds of her dress fluttered back in the
light breeze, and the night wind as it came sighing
over the crest had loosened her veil and tossed it
upwards. Mechanically as she raised her hand to
draw it back, the thin arm and hand seemed to point
upwards to something beyond what we could see.
Instinctively the others all drew back a few paces, and
closed in together as they watched the motionless
form. The sunset glories were more than we could
realise, but somehow we felt that she was gazing with
fixed eyes far, far beyond these—into a pure and
passionless region, beyond the mental grasp of the
profoundest theologian depending on his own acquired
knowledge. As we looked, though she moved no
limb, her breath came faster and faster. One or two
of us made a start forwards, but at that moment the
last red glow vanished from the belt of fleecy cloud
hanging in mid-sky. Lower down, the limestone
cliffs seemed strangely desolate as the icy hand of
night spread over them. The breeze suddenly
dropped and died away. She stamped her foot on
the snow, and with a quick movement of the head
seemed to come back again to the scene around.
<q>Let us go,</q> she said, half petulantly. Silently the
party arranged themselves in order as we wended our
way back along the ridge. We had seen a sight that
lingered in the mind, and that was not easily to be
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>erased from the memory. As we walked along
we gradually drew closer and closer together, prompted
by some feeling that all seemed to share alike—as if
the recollection of what we had just seen had dazed
the mind, and brought us face to face with some
influence beyond our ordinary thoughts, and as if
with nearer union we should not feel so powerless and
insignificant. But the glories of that sunset from the
Mont Buet, a scene within the reach of all of very
moderate walking ability, were far beyond the power
of any language to describe, and beyond the province
of any discreet writer to attempt. The twilight
gathered in fast, and the snow already felt more crisp
under foot. The roll-call was held, and it was discovered
that the only absentees were the moralist and
his propelling companion. At this point two of the
skilled mountaineers of the party recognised their
opportunity, and were not slow to seize it. Secretly
they had felt that no suitable occasion had hitherto
offered of displaying their prowess, so they volunteered
to perform a glissade for the amusement and
instruction of the others. The ladies clapped their
hands gleefully, and the youth, who did not know
how to glissade, looked sinister. Accordingly the
skilful ones made their way to a steep snow slope, and
started off with great speed and dexterity, amidst the
admiring plaudits of the less acrobatically minded
members. But the course of their true descent did
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>not run entirely smooth, for before half the downward
journey was accomplished the foremost member was
observed suddenly to propel himself wildly into the
air, performing a remarkable antic—similar to those
known of street Arabs as cart-wheels—and the remainder
of the journey to the foot of the slope was
performed with about the grace of a floating log
descending a mountain torrent. Nor was this all;
the rearmost man, apparently also possessed by an
identical frenzy, leaped forth into the air at precisely
the same spot and in precisely the same manner.
Had it not been that they were known to be highly
skilful and adroit mountaineers the impression might
have gained ground that the circumstances of this
part of the descent were not wholly under their own
control. Ever anxious to investigate the true cause
of strange occurrences, to their credit be it said that
when they had collected their wits and emptied their
pockets of snow, they mounted up again to the scene
of the disaster, and discovered the explanation in an
entirely imaginary stone, which had, beyond doubt,
tripped them up.
</p>

<note place="margin">The mountaineers perform</note>

<p>
Somewhat crestfallen, the energetic pair rejoined
the rest of the troupe and a search was instituted for
the moralist. This worthy was discovered, astonishingly
weary of body but surprisingly active of mind,
wedged in a narrow rocky niche, so that he looked
like the figure of a little <q>Joss</q> in the carved model
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>of a Japanese temple. It was found necessary to pull
him vigorously by the legs, in order to straighten out
those members sufficiently for him to progress upon
them. However, he seemed to have more to say
about the sunset than anybody else, and his description
of the beauties thereof was so glowing and eloquent,
that the idea crossed our minds that possibly
some of the descriptions we had read in Alpine
writings of similar scenes might be as authentic as
that with which he favoured us. <q>A great point in
the Alps,</q> remarked the moralist, after he had been
securely fastened by a rope to a guide for fear we
should lose him again, so that he looked like a
dancing bear—<q>a great point in walking amongst the
Alps is that we learn to use our eyes and look around
us. I have observed that those who perambulate our
native flagstones appear perpetually to be absorbed in
the contemplation of what lies at their feet. Now
here, stimulated by the beauties around, man holds,
as he should do, his head erect, and steps out boldly.</q>
At this point a little delay was occasioned owing to
the abrupt disappearance of the speaker through a
crust of snow. Some curious rumblings below our
feet seemed to imply that he had descended to a considerable
depth, and was in great personal discomfort.
In the dim light we could scarcely see what had
actually happened, but concluded to pull vigorously at
the rope as the best means of getting our temporarily
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>absent friend out of his difficulties. This we succeeded
in doing, and a strenuous haul on the cord
was rewarded by the sudden appearance of two boots
through the snow-crust at our feet—a phenomenon so
unexpected that we relaxed our efforts, with the result
that the boots immediately disappeared again. A
second attempt was more successful; an arm and a
leg this time came to the surface simultaneously, and
the moralist was delivered from the snowy recesses
broadside on. We rearranged his raiment, shook the
snow out of the creases of his clothes, tied a bath
towel round his head, which, for some obscure reason,
he had brought with him—the towel, not his head—and
harnessed him this time securely between two
members of the party. Possibly from the effects of
his misadventure, he remained silent for some time,
or his flow of conversation may have been hindered
by the fact that his supporters ran him violently down
steep places whenever he showed symptoms of commencing
a fresh dissertation. It was no easy task to
find the little hut in the darkness, and it was not
until after we had blundered about a good deal that
we caught sight of the beacon light, consisting of a
very cheap dip exhibited in the window, as a sign that
entertainment for man and beast might be found
within. The moralist, who was always to the fore
when the subject of refreshment was mentioned, discovered
a milking-stool, and drawing it in great
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>triumph to the best place in front of the stove, sat
down on it, with the immediate result that he was
precipitated backwards into the ash-pan. There we
left him, as being a suitable place for repentance.
</p>

<note place="margin">A banquet at the chalet</note>

<p>
The rest of the party gathered for supper round
the festive board, which was rather uncertain on its
legs, and inclined to tip up. Owing to some miscarriage,
the larder of the cabane was not well stocked,
and all the entertainment that could be furnished
consisted of one bent-up little sausage, exceeding
black and dry, and a very large teapot. However,
there was plenty of fresh milk provided after a short
interval, though the latter article was not obtained
without considerable difficulty, and remonstrances
proceeding from an adjoining shed, probably due to
somnolence on the part of the animal from which the
supply was drawn. Presently a great commotion, as
of numerous bodies rolling down a steep ladder, was
heard, and there appeared at the door a large collection
of small shock-headed children, who gaped at
us in silent wonder. Anxious to ascertain the physical
effects that might be induced by the consumption
of the sausage, the moralist, who amongst his
many talents had apparently a turn for experimental
physiology, cut off a block and placed it in the open
mouth of the eldest of the children. This unexpected
favour led to the boy’s swallowing the morsel whole,
and he shortly afterwards retired with a somewhat
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>pained expression of countenance; the other members
of the family followed shortly after in tears, in consequence
of the Italianised young lady, who possessed
a strong fund of human sympathy and a love
for the picturesque, having made an attempt to conciliate
their good-will by patting their respective heads,
and asking them their names in a conjectural <hi rend='italic'>patois</hi>.
We were now ready to start again, and demanded
of our hostess what there was to pay. This request
led her to go to the foot of the ladder, which represented
a staircase, and call out for the proprietor. A
little black-headed man in response instantly precipitated
himself down the steps, shot into the apartment,
and, without any preliminary calculation, named the
exact price. On receiving his money he scuttled away
again like a frightened rabbit, brought the change,
jerked it down on the table, and darted off again to
his slumbers. The whole transaction occupied some
five-and-twenty seconds.
</p>

<p>
Part of the programme consisted in descending
back to Argentière by lantern-light, but the resources
of the establishment could only produce one battered
machine, and it was no easy task with this illumination
to keep the members of the party from straying
away from the narrow path. Indeed, several members
did part from the rest, curiously enough in pairs;
but before long we left the narrow defile, and as we
passed from under the shelter of the slope on our
<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>right, and could see across the Chamouni valley, we
came suddenly in view of the great mass of the
Aiguille Verte, so suddenly, indeed, that it made us
start back for the moment; for, illumined by a grey
ghostly light, the mountain seemed at first to hang right
over us. There is, perhaps, no finer view of the Aiguille
Verte to be obtained than from this point; certainly
no finer effects of light and shade than were granted
by the conditions under which we saw it, could have
been devised to show the peak off to the best advantage.
So long did we delay to dwell on the fairy-like
scene, that the vacuous youth, accompanied by the
young lady of varied accomplishments, caught us up
and joined us quite suddenly, to their exceeding confusion.
The youth, without being invited to do so,
explained, blushing violently the while, that they had
lost the path in the darkness, and had only been able
to regain the track by lighting a series of lucifer
matches—an entire fiction on his part, but condoned,
as evincing more readiness of wit than we had previously
given him credit for. We heard also that their
way had been barred by a swamp and a mountain
stream, which, like gossip, can have had no particular
origin. The young lady, mindful of the absence of
her preceptress and consequently heedless of grammar,
described the situation neatly as being <q>awfully bogs.</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">The end of the journey</note>

<p>
If the expedition had shown us no more than this
moonlight effect, the reward would have been ample.
<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>In truth, from first to last the expedition was one
which it would be hard to match for variety of interest
in all the sub-Alpine district. At Argentière we rejoined
the carriages, and found the horses just a
little more inclined for exertion than they had been in
the morning; their joy at going home seemed to be
tempered by the fact that they recognised that they
would inevitably be called upon to start from the
same point at no very distant period; and that to
return home was but to go back to the starting-point
for further laborious excursions. But their equine
tempers seemed thoroughly soured. The Italianised
young lady was taken in charge by her elder
sister, who had completed her education, and knew
consequently the hollowness of the world and the
folly of younger sisters’ flirtations, and securely
lodged in the landau. The youth, after an ineffectual
attempt to find a place in the same carriage, climbed
to the box seat of the other vehicle, and relieved his
feelings by cracking the driver’s whip with great
dexterity; in fact, we discovered that this was one of
his principal accomplishments. Not the least satisfactory
part of the climb, in the estimation of some
members of the party, was the fact that the moralist
had lost his note-book during his imprisonment in the
crevasse.

The following account is somewhat of a puzzle. It
appears to contain certain facts of so startling a
nature, that the ascent to which they refer must unquestionably
have been of a very exciting character.
The details are not so wholly unlike descriptions
which have passed the searching discrimination of
editors, in publications relating more or less to Alpine
matters, as to warrant the assumption that they are
fabrications. They do not appear, as far as the writer
can ascertain, to have been seen in print hitherto;
but as all Alpine writings relate but rigid matters of
fact and actual occurrences, there seems no objection
to publishing the manuscript, notwithstanding that its
authorship is only conjectural. It is unfortunate that
its fragmentary nature leaves one somewhat in doubt
as to the actual peak to which the description refers.
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>It has been suggested by a plausible commentator,
judging from internal evidence and the style of
writing, that the manuscript of which the fragment
consists formed part of an account originally intended
for some work not published in this country, or even,
possibly, was primarily designed to fill the columns of
one of our own daily newspapers during the silly
season.
</p>

<note place="margin">I rise equal to the occasion</note>

<p>
<q>... The day was cloudless, serene, and bright.
Only in the immediate foreground did the heavy
banks, betokening a <hi rend='italic'>tourmente</hi>, sweep around with
relentless fury. Far above, the towering crags of the
majestic peak pierced the sky. How to get there!
And alone! The situation was sublime; yet more, it
was fascinating; once again, it was enthralling. Far
below lay the prostrate bodies of my companions,
worn out, wearied, gorged with <hi rend='italic'>petit vin</hi> and sardines.
A thought flashed across my mind. Why should I
not scale alone these heights which had hitherto
defied the most consummate <hi rend='italic'>intrépides</hi>? In a
moment the resolution was taken. For me, for me
alone, should the laurel wreaths be twined. For me
should the booming cannon, charged with fifty
centimes’ worth of uncertain powder, betoken victory.
For me alone should the assortment of cheap flags
which had done duty on many previous occasions of
rejoicing, be dragged forth. What was the expense
to a hero when the glow of so magnificent an
achieve<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>ment should swell his heart and loosen his purse-strings?
The account might reach a sum of two and a
half, nay, even five francs; but what of that? I girded
myself with the trusty rope, and, attaching one end
lightly to a projecting crag twenty feet above, hauled
myself in a moment on to the eminence. Involuntarily
I shot a glance downwards. The scene
was fearful—one to make the most resolute
quail. But there was no time for thought, still
less for accurate description. A fearfully steep
couloir, flanked by two yawning bergschrunds,
stretched away horizontally right and left. How to
cross them! It was the work of a moment. Unfastening
the knot in the rope above me, I threw
myself, heart and soul, into the work. Where heart
and soul are, there must, in the ante-mortem state, be
the body also. This is logic. Thus I entered the
chasm. Battling desperately with the huge icicles
that threatened me at every step, I forced my way
through the snow bridge and breathed again. The
first schrund was accomplished. Next the rope was
fastened to my trusty axe, and with an herculean
effort I threw it far above me; fortunately it caught
in a notch, and in a few seconds I had climbed, with
the agility of a monkey, up the tightened cord.
Goodness gracious! (<hi rend='italic'>sapristi!</hi>) what do I hear? A
sudden roar below betokened an immediate danger.
Horror! sweeping and roaring up the slope from the
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>glacier beneath, I beheld a huge avalanche. I will
conceal nothing. I own that the appalling situation
and its terribly dramatic nature forced me to ejaculate
a cry. I do not claim originality for it. I said, <q>Oh!
my mother!</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Oh! ma mère!</hi>) This relieved me.
Now was the time indeed for coolness. Fortunate,
most fortunate, that I was alone. Thrusting the
spike of the axe into the solid rock face like the spear
of Ithuriel, in the twinkling of an eye I had fastened
one end of the rope to the projecting head of the axe,
and the other to my waist, and launched myself over
the ridge into space. Fortunate, most fortunate
again, as in the hurry of the moment I had attached
the rope below my own centre of gravity, that I was
light-headed. Had this not been the case, assuredly
I should have dangled feet uppermost over the abyss.
Not a moment too soon. The avalanche dashed up the
slope, grinding the axe to powder, but by good luck
entangling the rope between the massive blocks and
carrying it up, with myself attached, nearly 100
metres—I should say 300 feet—above where I had
previously stood. I had accomplished in a moment
what might have cost hours of toil. Again it was
sublime. The thought crossed my mind that the
sublime often approaches the ridiculous. But the
rocks, previously broken up, had been ground by the
sweeping avalanche into a surface smooth as polished
steel. How to descend these again! Banish the
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>thought! The mountain was not yet climbed.
Upwards, past yawning séracs, towering bergschrunds,
slippery crevasses, gaping arêtes, I made my way.
For a few hundred feet I bounded upwards with great
rapidity. Despite the rugged nature of the rocks
everything went smoothly. Of a sudden a terrible
obstacle was presented to my gaze. I felt that all
my hopes seemingly were dashed. A stupendous
cleft, riving the mountain’s side to an unfathomable
depth, barred further progress. From top to
bottom both sides of the chasm overhung; and far
below, where they joined, the angle of meeting was
so sharp that I felt that I must infallibly be
wedged in without hope of extrication if I fell.
For a few moments I hesitated, but only for a few.
Close by was a tower of rock, smooth and vertical,
some twelve feet high—the height of two men, in fact.
No handhold save on the top. This was but a simple
matter. Had any one else been with me, I should
have stood on his shoulders; as it was I stood on my
own head. Thus I climbed to the summit of the
pointed obelisk of rock. Exactly opposite, on the
farther side of the cleft, was a similar rock cone, but
the distance was too great to spring across. I was in
a dilemma—on one horn of it, in fact; how to get
to the other! I adopted an ingenious plan. Taking
my trusty axe, I placed the pointed end in a little
notch in the rock, and then, with herculean strength,
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>bent the staff and wedged the head also into a notch.
The trusty axe was now bent like a bow. Again I
hesitated before trusting myself to the bow; in fact,
it was long before I drew it. But a former experience
stood me in good stead. Once before, driven by a
less powerful impetus—merely that of a human leg—I
had flown through a greater distance. I made up
my mind, and, summoning all my fortitude, placed
my back against the arc and, lightly touching one
end, released the spring. Instantly I felt myself
propelled straight into mid-air, and before I had time
to realise the success of my scheme, was flung against
the pinnacle on the opposite side and embraced it.
What were my feelings on finding that this huge
pinnacle had no more stability than a ninepin, and
as my weight came on to it slowly heeled over! Nor
was this all. Slowly, like the pendulum of a metronome,
it rolled back again, and I found to my horror
that I was clinging to the apex of the rock, and
dangling right over the chasm! I cannot recall that
in all my adventures I had ever been in a precisely
similar situation. However, a hasty calculation satisfied
me that the rocking crag must again right itself.
As I expected, it did so, and as the pinnacle of rock
swung back once more to the perpendicular I sprang
from it with all my force. The impetus landed me safe,
but the crag toppled over into the abyss. Here I noted
an interesting scientific fact. Taking out my watch,
<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>I was able to estimate, by the depth of the cleft, the
height I had already climbed. <hi rend='italic'>The boulder took a
minute and a half in falling before it reached anywhere.</hi>
I own that the escape was a narrow one, and even my
unblushing cheek paled a little at the thought of it.
But I could not be far now, I hoped, from the summit;
and, indeed, the condition of a dead bird which it so
happened lay on the rocks—in a passive sense—convinced
me that the summit of the lofty peak was
close at hand. But few obstacles now remained.
Another step or two revealed a glassy unbroken rock
cone leading to the summit. It seemed impossible at
first to surmount it, but my resources were not yet at
an end. Dragging off my boots, I tore out with my
teeth the long nails and drove them in one after
another. By this means I ascended the first half of
the final peak; but then the supply of nails was
exhausted, and I felt that time would not permit me
to draw out the lower nails and place them in succession
above the others. Luckily I still carried with
me a flask of the execrable <hi rend='italic'>petit vin</hi> supplied by Mons.
—— of the inn below. I applied a little to the rock.
The effect was magical. In a moment the hard face
was softened to the consistence of cheese, and with
my trusty axe I had no difficulty in scraping out
small steps. The worst was now over. Just as the
shades of night were gathering softly around, I
stepped with the proud consciousness of victory on to
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>the very highest point. This indeed was sublime.
The toil of years was accomplished; it seemed almost
a dream. Nerved to frenzy, with a mighty sweep of
the axe I struck off a huge block from the summit to
carry away as a token of conquest, and planting the
weapon in the hole, tore off garment after garment to
make a suitable flag; only did I desist on reflecting
that it would become barely possible for me to descend
if I acted thus. Intoxicated with victory, I shouted
and sang for a while, and then turned to the descent.
The night was fast closing in, but this mattered not,
for I made light of all the obstacles, and they were so
numerous that I succeeded perfectly by this means in
seeing my way. Faster and faster I sped along,
descending with ease over the blocks and fragments of
the morning’s avalanche. Now and again the descent
was assisted by fastening the rope securely to projecting
crags, and then allowing myself to slide down to
its full length. Then I went up again, untied the rope,
fastened it anew below, and repeated the manœuvre.
Thus at midnight I reached the edge of the cliff, at
the foot of which my companions had been left in the
morning. I feared they might be anxious for my
safety, the more especially that I had not yet paid
them for their services. Peering over the edge of the
vertical precipice into the murky darkness, I called
out. There was no response. Then I said <q>Pst,</q> and
tapped the glassy slope with my pocket knife. Even
<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>this plan failed to attract their attention. I shouted
with still more force. Finally, standing up on the
edge of the cliff, I sent forth a shout so terribly loud
that it must have waked even a sleeping adder. A
fatal error! for the reverberation of my voice was
echoed back with such fearful force from a neighbouring
crag that the shock struck me backwards, and in
a moment I was flying through mid-air—to annihilation.</q>

<q>There is a blank in this narrative which I can
never fill up. This only do I know; that when I
came again to my senses, I was warmly ensconced in
a blanket, whilst my companions stood around in a
circle shivering, as they gazed at me with amazement.
Their account, which I can scarcely credit, was that
as they were engaged in stretching out and shaking a
blanket preparatory to spreading their bed for the
night, an apparently heaven-sent form had descended
from above into the very middle of it; the shock tore
the blanket from their grasp, and in a twinkling I lay
wrapt up safe and comfortable at their feet.</q>

Such is the fragment. It has been thought better

<note place="margin">The critics</note>
<p>
From time to time, when some accident has happened
in the Alps, the press and the public have been
pleased to take such unfortunate occurrence as a text,
and to preach serious sermons to mountaineers. We
have been called hard names in our time; we have
been accused of fostering an amusement of no earthly-practical
good, and one which has led to <q>miserable</q>
waste of valuable life. Gentle expressions of animadversion,
such as <q>criminal folly,</q> <q>reckless venture,
which has no better purpose than the gratification
of a caprice or the indulgence of a small ambition,</q> <q>a
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>subject of humiliating interest,</q> and the like, have
at times been freely used. But it is well known to
authors and to dramatists that criticisms of a nature
known as <q>smashing</q> are not, on the whole, always
to be deplored, and are occasionally the best to enhance
the success of the work. The novel or play, however
unreservedly condemned by the reviewer, has got
some chance of living if it be hinted that some of the
situations in it are a little <hi rend='italic'>risquées</hi>; and to a great
many the idea seems constantly present that mountaineering
owes its principal attraction to the element
of risk inseparable from its pursuit. As an
absolute matter of fact such is not the case. Apart
from this, however, mountaineers may be thankful
that the critics in question have, when they noticed
our doings at all, condemned us very heartily indeed,
and thundered forth their own strictures on
our folly in sonorous terms; in fact, attacks of this
nature have by no means impaired the vitality of
such associations as Alpine clubs, but rather, like
attacks of distemper in dogs, have increased their
value.
</p>

<p>
It would be easy enough, from the mountaineer’s
point of view, and in a work which, at
the best, can interest only those who have some
sympathy with climbing as a pure pastime, to pass
over these hard words, and to reckon them as merely
the vapourings of envious mortals not initiated into
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>the mysteries of the mountaineering craft; but such
criticisms may lead or perhaps reflect public opinion,
and are not, therefore, to be treated lightly. It might
be held that for any notice to be taken at all is complimentary,
and we might seek shelter in the epigrammatic
saying that he who has no enemies has no
character; that though hope may spring eternal in
the human breast, jealousy is a trait still more constantly
found. But this line of argument is not one
to be adopted. The <hi rend='italic'>tu quoque</hi> style of defence is not
one well calculated to gain a verdict. No doubt the
question has been treated often enough before, and
in discussing it the writer may seem but to be doing
what nowadays the climber is forced to do in the Alps—namely,
wander again, perhaps ramble, over ground
that has been well trodden many times before. But the
conditions have changed greatly since mountaineering
first became a popular pastime, and since the first editions
of <q>Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</q> were rapidly sold
out. It is, the writer fears, only too true in these
latter days that mountaineers may be classified as Past
and Present. Whether a third class may be added of
<q>the Future</q> is a question—to be answered, I hope,
in the affirmative.
</p>

<note place="margin">Growth of the amusement</note>

<p>
The Alpine Club was founded in 1857 by a few
ardent devotees to what was then an entirely new
form of pastime. The original members of that
club could never have even dreamed of the wide
<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>popularity mountaineering was destined to acquire,
or the influence that the establishment of the Alpine
Club was to have on it; and, like the fish in an
aquarium, they can hardly have known what they
were in for. In the present day there are Alpine
clubs in almost every country in Europe, and in some
countries there are several, numbering their members
in some cases by thousands. Nor is it only on the
continent of Europe that there are mountaineering
clubs. Not that the writer ventures to assert that
every member of this multitude is devoted to the high
Alps, or that it is in the least degree essential to
climb high and difficult mountains in order to learn
the fascination of their natural beauties. It may be
pointed out, however, that the <q>miserable waste of
valuable life</q> is in the greatest part not on the great
peaks and passes, but on little hills. Every year we
read of accidents on mountains such as the Faulhorn,
the Monte Salvatore in the Alps, or Snowdon, Helvellyn
and the like in our own country. Possibly these
disasters might never have taken place had the experience
of mountaineering craft gained in high
regions been properly appreciated and utilised. The
good surgeon is he who, utilising all his own and all
his predecessors’ experience, recognises, and makes
provision against, all the risks that may conceivably
be involved in the most trifling operation he may be
called upon to perform; and holiday ramblers in our
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>own land and in sub-Alpine regions might, not without
advantage, profit by the example.
</p>
<note place="margin">Novelty and exploration</note>
<p>
Five-and-twenty years ago in Switzerland there
were numberless heights untrodden, passes uncrossed,
and regions unexplored. Then, moreover, there were
comparatively but few to cross the passes or climb
the mountains; but those few did mighty deeds.
Peak after peak fell before them, while slowly but
surely they opened up new regions and brought unexpected
beauties to light. In those days climbing
as an art was but in its infancy, restricted to a few
amateurs specially qualified to pursue it, and to a very
limited number of guides—merely those, in fact (not
such a numerous class as people seem generally to
imagine), who had made chamois-hunting one of the
principal objects of their lives. Gradually the art
became more developed, and with the increase of
power thus acquired came increase of confidence. From
the fact that the training in the mountaineering art
was gradual, it was necessarily thorough—a fact that
a good many climbers would do well to bear in mind
in these latter days. Then, of course, the charm of
novelty, so dear to the mountaineer, was seldom
absent; he could strike out right or left and find
virgin soil; but in quest of novelty search had to be
made before long in remote regions. It followed
that exploration was not limited, and the early
pioneers of mountaineering could, and did learn more
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>of the geography and varied beauties of the Alps in
a single season than their followers do, in the present
day, in five or six.
</p>

<p>
After a while the fashion of mountaineering altered
sensibly, and a strong conservatism sprang up.
Certain districts became more and more frequented;
certain peaks acquired special popularity, either because
they were conveniently placed and ready of
access; or because there was a certain touch of
romance about them, as in the case of the Matterhorn;
or because they had acquired the reputation
of being difficult, and it was thought that a
successful ascent would stamp the climber at once as
a skilful person and a very daring creature. Thus
places like Zermatt, Grindelwald, Chamouni, and the
Æggischhorn became the great centres of mountaineering,
and have remained so ever since. Independent
exploration gradually gave way to the
charm of meeting others bent on the same pursuit
of climbing; but this feeling was not without its
drawbacks, and tended to check what has been called
cosmopolitanism in mountaineering. How few, even
among those who visit the Alps regularly, know
anything whatever of such large, important, and interesting
districts as the Silvretta group, the Rheinwald
group, or the Lepontine Alps! while districts
like Zermatt are thronged and crowded, and the
mountains absolutely done to death. Not that it
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>is hard to understand how this narrowing of the
field of mountaineering has been brought about.
There comes a time of life to most men when they
find more pleasure in meeting old friends than in
making new acquaintances; and the same feeling
would appear to extend to the mountains.
</p>

<p>
It must be confessed here that the writer is disposed
to look upon mountaineering in the Alps, in the
sense in which it has hitherto been known, as a
pastime that will before long become extinct. In
some soils trees grow with extraordinary rapidity and
vigour, but do not strike their roots very deep, and so
are prone to early decay. Still, it does not follow
that, even should these pessimist forebodings prove
true, and climbing be relegated to the limbo of archaic
pursuits, the Alps will not attract their thousands as
they have done for many years. The dearth of
novelty is sometimes held to be the principal cause
that will eventually lead to the decay of mountaineering.
There is a reasonable probability, however, to
judge from the Registrar-General’s reports, that the
world will still be peopled some time hence, and
possibly a generation will then arise of mountaineering
revivalists who, never having tasted the flavour
of novelty in Alpine climbing, will not perceive that
its absence is any loss. Yet in the Alps alone many
seem to forget that, while they are exhausting in
every detail a few spots, there are numerous and
<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>varied expeditions of similar nature still to be accomplished,
the scenes of which lie within a few hours of
London. It is of course only to mountaineering as
a semi-fashionable craze that these remarks apply.
The knowledge of the art, acquired primarily in the
Alps, which has led to the development of mountaineering
as a science will not be wasted, and the
training acquired in holiday expeditions, when amusement
or the regaining of health was the principal
object, can be turned to valuable practical account
elsewhere. So shall there be a future for mountaineering.
No doubt but few may be able to find the
opportunity, unless indeed they make it somewhat of
a profession, of exploring the great mountainous
districts still almost untouched—such, for instance, as
the Himalayas. But it is in some such direction as
this that the force of the stream, somewhat tending
to dry up in its original channel, will, it may be hoped,
spread in the future.
</p>

<note place="margin">The upward limit</note>

<p>
It has already been shown, by the results of many
modern expeditions, that the old views that obtained
with respect to the upward limit of mountaineering
must, to say the least, be considerably modified.
From early times the question of the effects of rarefied
air in high regions on mountaineers has attracted
attention. As a matter of fact the subject is still
barely in its infancy. A few remarks on this point
<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>may not perhaps be thought too technical, for they
bear, I hope, on the mountaineering of the future.
</p>

<p>
It is matter of notoriety that in these days travellers
seem less subject to discomfort in the high Alps than
in former times. De Saussure, for instance, in the
account of his famous ascent of Mont Blanc in 1787,
speaks a good deal of the difficulty of respiration. At
his bivouac on the Plateau, at an elevation of 13,300
feet, the effects of the rarefied air were much commented
on; and these remarks are the more valuable,
inasmuch as De Saussure was a man of science and
a most acute observer; while his account, a thing
too rare in these days, is characterised by extreme
modesty of description. The frequency of the respirations,
he observed, which ensued on any exertion
caused great fatigue. Nowadays, however, pedestrians,
often untrained, may be seen daily ascending
at a very much faster pace than De Saussure seems
to have gone, and yet the effects are scarcely felt.
No one now expects much to suffer from this cause,
and no one does. In recent times we hear accounts
of ascents of mountains like Elbruz, 18,526 feet, by
Mr. Grove and others; of Cotopaxi, 19,735 feet, and
Chimborazo, 20,517<note place="foot">This is Mr. Edward Whymper’s measurement. Humboldt, as
quoted by Mr. Whymper, gave 21,460 feet as the height. (<hi rend='italic'>Alpine
Journal</hi>, vol. x. p. 442.)</note> feet, by Mr. Whymper; and the
most recent, and by far the most remarkable, of
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>Kabru in the Himalayas, about 24,000 feet, by Mr.
Graham. In all these expeditions the travellers
spent nights in bivouacs far above the level of the
Grand Plateau where De Saussure encamped. We
cannot suppose that in the Caucasus, the Andes, or
the Himalayas the air differs much from that of the
Alps with regard to its rarefaction effects on travellers.
In fact, the Alpine traveller would in this respect
probably be much better off, for the general conditions
surrounding him would be more like those to
which he was accustomed. He would not have, for
instance, to contend with the effects of changed or
meagre diet or unaccustomed climate.
</p>

<note place="margin">Mr. Grove’s views</note>

<p>
Mr. F. C. Grove, a very high authority on such a
point, in his description of the ascent of Elbruz, in
the course of some remarks on the rarity of the air,
states his belief that at some height or another, less than
that of the loftiest mountain, there must be a limit at
which no amount of training and good condition will
enable a man to live; and he says, <q>It may be taken
for granted that no human being could walk to the
top of Mount Everest.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>The Frosty Caucasus</hi>, by F. C. Grove, p. 236.</note> This was written in 1875;
but a great deal has happened since then, though the
same opinion is still very generally entertained. But
with this opinion I cannot coincide at all, for reasons
that appear to me logically conclusive. In the first
place, a party of three, composed of Mr. Graham,
<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>Herr Emil Boss, and the Swiss guide Kauffman, have
ascended more than 5,000 feet higher than the top of
Elbruz, and none of the party experienced any serious
effect, or, indeed, apparently any effect at all other
than those naturally incidental to severe exertion. It
must be admitted that one result of their expedition
was to prove, tolerably conclusively, that Mount
Everest is not the highest mountain in the world.
Still, until it is officially deposed, it may be taken, for
argument’s sake, as the ultimate point. Now, it
would seem to be beyond doubt that a man, being
transported to a height much greater than Mount
Everest, can still live. In Messrs. Coxwell and
Glaisher’s famous balloon ascent from Wolverhampton
on September 5, 1862, described in <q>Travels
in the Air,</q> it was computed that the travellers
reached a height of nearly 37,000 feet,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Travels in the Air</hi>, edited by James Glaisher, F.R.S., p. 57
<anchor id="corr310"/><corr sic="2nd">(2nd</corr> ed.).</note> and this
in less than an hour from the time of leaving the
earth. Deduct 5,000 feet from this computation, to
allow for possible error, and we still have a height left
of 32,000 feet, an elevation, that is, very considerably
greater than the summit of Mount Everest—possibly
a greater elevation than the summit of any mountain.
Life then, it is proved, can be sustained at such a height,
and the point that remains for consideration is whether
the necessary exertion of walking or climbing to the
same height would render the actual ascent impossible.
</p>

<pb n='311'/><anchor id='Pg311'/>

<note place="margin">Mr. Glaisher’s experiences</note>

<p>
Since the days of De Saussure some 8,000 feet
have been added to the height to which the possibility
of ascending has been proved. It seems to me
unreasonable to assume that another 5,000 feet may
not yet be added, and arbitrary to conclude that
at some point higher than Kabru but lower than
Mount Everest the limit of human endurance must
necessarily be reached. Mr. Glaisher himself does
not appear to think that, from his experience, any
such ascent as that we have been considering would
be possible for an Alpine traveller (<hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi> p. 21 and
elsewhere). But, with every deference to so great an
authority, a few considerations may be submitted
which tend most seriously to invalidate his conclusions
and opinions, and which may serve to show also that
the effects of rarefied air probably differ more widely
in the two cases of the aëronaut and the mountaineer
than is generally supposed. Writing in 1871, Mr.
Glaisher says,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Op. cit.</hi> p. 9.</note> <q>At a height of three miles I never
experienced any annoyance or discomfort; yet there
is no ascent I think of Mont Blanc in which great
inconvenience and severe <hi rend='italic'>pain</hi> have not been felt at a
height of 13,000 feet; but then, as before remarked,
this is an elevation attained only after two days of
excessive toil.</q> Mr. Glaisher is here referring chiefly
to Dr. Hamel’s ascent of Mont Blanc, and would
seem apparently to be unaware that, long before he
wrote, the ascent of Mont Blanc, from Chamouni and
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>back to the same place, had been accomplished within
twenty-four hours. In 1873, if my memory serves
me right, Mr. Passingham started from Chamouni,
ascended the mountain, and returned to his hotel in
a little less than twenty hours.<note place="foot">I understand that the expedition has since been accomplished
in a much shorter time.</note> Compare such an
ascent as this—not by any means an isolated
instance—with De Saussure’s experience, and when
we consider how remarkable has been the <anchor id="corr312"/><corr sic="developmen">development</corr>
of mountaineering in this direction, we may surely hold
that to fix at present any absolute limit is unduly
arbitrary. Further, the ascents of Chimborazo and
the other mountains named above have all been
accomplished since Mr. Glaisher wrote. Mr. Glaisher
states that the aëronaut may acclimatise himself to
great heights by repeated ascents; but how much
more may the mountaineer then hope to do so! The
aëronaut necessarily makes ascents rapidly<note place="foot">In Messrs. Coxwell and Glaisher’s ascent from Wolverhampton
the balloon when at the height of 29,000 feet was mounting at the
rate of 1,000 feet a minute.</note> and at
rare intervals. The mountaineer can acclimatise
himself to high regions by a constant and <anchor id="corr312a"/><corr sic="gradua">gradual</corr>
process, a method obviously better calculated to extend
the limits of his endurance.

Of course I am only discussing the actual possibility,
not entering into the question for a moment
of whether it is worth while to do it. It may be that
<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>to attempt an ascent of Mount Everest would prove
almost as rash an undertaking as an endeavour to
swim through the Niagara rapids—that is, if the
mountaineering difficulties are so great as to make
the two instances parallel. Two points have to be
considered: one, that, granted the desirability of
making such an ascent, we do not yet fully know the
best manner of undertaking it; and another, that we
are still very ignorant as to the physiological effects of
rarefied air on the human frame.<note place="foot">I am aware of M. Paul Bert’s researches; but these questions
are not to be settled in the laboratory.</note>
</p>

<note place="margin">Mountain acclimatisation</note>

<p>
With regard to the first point, we know indeed
this much—that, granted good condition, a man can
<q>acclimatise</q> himself to great heights, and when
so acclimatised he can undergo much more exertion
in very high regions with much less effect. The
experience of Mr. Whymper in the Andes, and of
Mr. Graham and others in the Himalayas, has shown
this conclusively enough. Let a man sleep at a
height, say, of 18,000 feet, and then ascend from that
point another 3,000 or 4,000 feet; he may possibly
feel the effects to be so great that an attempt to
sleep again at the latter height would render him
incapable of exertion the next day, as far as an
ascent is concerned. Let him descend till he can
bivouac, say at 20,000 feet, and then again try,
starting afresh. After a while he would be able to
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>accomplish still more than at his first attempt; and so
on, until he reached the summit. But even supposing
that no amount of acclimatisation enables him
to accomplish his end, he has other weapons in his
armoury.
</p>
<note place="margin">Ascent of Mount Everest</note>
<p>
The second point mentioned above is that the
physiological effects of rarefied air on the human
economy are but little known; were these understood
the resources of science might be called in to obviate
them. It may be said that no amount of science will
obviate the very simple fact that exertion causes
fatigue, but the answer is that we have no real idea
of all the causes which lead to this fatigue. This is
not the place to speculate on a somewhat abstruse
and unquestionably complicated physiological problem,
but the direction in which the question may be
approached from the scientific side is worthy of being
pointed out. This much may be said, however, that
when we talk of strong heart and strong lungs in
connection with the question of the possibility of
ascending on foot to the greatest altitudes, we are
only, from the physiological point of view, taking into
account one or two factors, and perhaps not the most
important ones. The cavillers may be reminded
that physiology is not and never will become a
finite science. To my mind at least, as far as
human endurance is concerned, it would be no more
surprising to me to hear that a man had succeeded
<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>in walking up Mount Everest than to know that a
man can succeed in standing an arctic climate while
on a sledging expedition. Objections like the difficulty
of arranging for a supply of food, of expense, of risk,
and so forth, are not taken into account—they are
really beside the question: they have not proved insuperable
obstacles in the case of arctic exploration;
they will not prove insurmountable to the ambitious
mountaineer we are contemplating. I do not for a
moment say that it would be wise to ascend Mount
Everest, but I believe most firmly that it is humanly
possible to do so; and, further, I feel sure that, even
in our own time, perhaps, the truth of these views will
receive material corroboration. Mount Everest itself
may offer insuperable mountaineering obstacles, but in
the unknown, unseen district to the north there may
be peaks of equal height presenting no more technical
difficulties than Mont Blanc or Elbruz.
</p>
<note place="margin">The value of mountaineering</note>
<p>
From the purely athletic point of view, then, the
mountaineering experience which has been gained
almost exclusively in the Alps may, by a still further
development in the future, enable the climber so to
develop the art that he may reach the highest elevation
on this world’s crust; and he may do this without
running undue risk. <hi rend='italic'>Cui bono?</hi> it may be asked;
and it is nearly as hard to answer the question as it
is to explain to the supine and unaspiring person the
good that may be expected to accrue to humanity by
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>reaching the North Pole; yet the latter project, albeit
to some it seems like a struggle of man against physical
forces which make or mar worlds, is one that is held
to be right and proper to be followed. At the least
an observer, even of limited powers, may reasonably
be expected, supposing he accomplished such a feat
as the ascent of Mount Everest, to bring back results
of equal scientific value with the arctic traveller, while
the purely geographical information he should gain
would have fiftyfold greater practical value. The
art and science of mountaineering has been learned
and developed in the Alps, and the acquirement of
this learning has been a pleasure to many. If the
holiday nature of mountaineering should in the future
be somewhat dropped, and if a few of those who
follow should take up the more serious side, and make
what has been a pastime into a profession (and why
should not some do so? That which is worth doing
at all is worth developing to the utmost possible limit),
good will come, unless it be argued that there is no
gain in extending geographical knowledge; and no
advantage in rectifying surveys and rendering them as
accurate as possible. As has been remarked by Mr.
Douglas Freshfield, the advantage of including in
survey parties, such as are still engaged on our Indian
frontier, the services of some who have made mountaineering
a branch to be learnt in their profession,
would be very distinct. Work done in the Alps
<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>would, in this direction, perhaps, bear the best fruit
and reap the highest practical value which it might
be hoped to attain. The value would be real. The
search after truth, whether it be in the fields of
natural science, of geography, or its to-be-adopted
sister orography, can never fail to be right and good
and beneficial. Enthusiasm all this! you say.
Granted freely. Without some enthusiasm and
energy the world would cease to turn, and the retarding
section of mankind would be triumphant,
save that they would be too languid to realise the
victory of their principles.
</p>

<p>
But still, if properly qualified men are to be forthcoming
to meet such a want, which undoubtedly
seems to exist, the old training-ground must not be
deserted; the playground of Europe must be regarded
in relation to serious work in the same light that the
playing-fields of Eton were regarded by one who was
somewhat of an authority. The Great Duke’s remark
is too well known to need quotation. English folk
may find it hard to hold their own against their
near relations in athletic pursuits, such as cricket
and sculling, but in mountaineering they undoubtedly
lead, and will continue to do so. In one phase indeed
of the pursuit their supremacy is menaced. In the
matter of recognising the practical value to be obtained
from mountaineering in surveying and the like, they are
already behind other countries. The roll of honorary
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>members of the Alpine Club comprises a list of men,
most of whom have utilised their mountaineering
experience to good purpose in advancing scientific
exploration. In this department it is to be hoped
that we shall not suffer ourselves to be outstripped,
nor allow a store of valuable and laboriously acquired
experience to remain wasted. The threatening cloud
may pass off; the future of Alpine mountaineering
may not prove to be so gloomy as it sometimes seems
to the writer in danger of gradually becoming. The
depression is, possibly, only temporary, and a natural
consequence of reaction; and the zigzagging line on
the chart, though it may never perhaps rise again to
the point it once marked, yet may keep well at the
normal—better, perhaps, at such a level than at fever
heat. The old cry that we know so well on the
mountains, that meets always with a ready thrill
of response, may acquire a wider significance, and
men will be found to answer to the familiar call of
<q>Vorwärts, immer vorwärts!</q>
</p>

<p>
After all, a century hence the mountaineering
centres of to-day will perhaps still attract as they do
now. It may be possible to get to Chamouni without
submitting to the elaborately devised discomfort of
the present Channel passage, and without the terrors
of asphyxiation in the carriages of the Chemin de Fer
du Nord. Surely the charm of the mountains must
always draw men to the Alps, even though the glaciers
<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>may have shrunk up and sunk down, though places
like Arolla and the Grimsel may have become thriving
towns, or radical changes such as a drainage system
at Chamouni have been instituted. If the glaciers do
shrink, there will be all the more scope for the rock
climber and the more opportunity of perfecting an art
which has already been so much developed.
</p>

<note place="margin">An Alpine Rip van Winkle</note>

<p>
A Rip van Winkle of our day, waking up in that
epoch of the future, would for certain find much that
was unaltered. The same types of humanity would
be around him. Conceive this somnolent hero of
fiction, clad in a felt wideawake that had once been
white, in knickerbockers and Norfolk jacket, of which
the seams had at one time held together, supporting
his bent frame and creaking joints on a staff with
rusted spike and pick. He descends laboriously
from a vehicle that had jolted impartially generations
before him (for the carriages of the valley are as little
liable to wear out, in the eyes of their proprietors, as
the <q>wonderful one-hoss shay</q>). He finds himself
on a summer evening by the Hôtel de Ville at
Chamouni, and facing the newly erected Opera-house.
He looks with wondering eyes around. A youth
(great-great-great-great-grandson of Jacques Balmat)
approaches and waits respectfully by his side, ready to
furnish information.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why these flags and these rejoicings?</q> the old
man asks.
</p>

<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>

<p>
<q>To celebrate the tercentenary of the first ascent
of Mont Blanc,</q> the boy answers.
</p>

<p>
The veteran gazes around, shading his eyes with
his shrivelled hand. The travellers come in. First
a triumphal procession of successful and intrepid
mountaineers. Banners wave, cannon go off—or
more probably miss fire—bouquets are displayed,
champagne and compliments are poured out; both
the latter expressions of congratulation equally gassy,
and both about equally genuine.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who are these?</q> the old man inquires.
</p>

<p>
<q>Do you not see the number on their banner?</q>
answers the youth; <q>they are the heroes of the forty-fifth
section of the tenth branch of the northern
division of the Savoy Alpine Club.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah!</q> the old man murmurs to himself, with a
sigh of recollection, <q>I can remember that they were
numerous even in my day.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then follows a sad-looking, dejected creature, stealing
back to his hotel by byways, but with face bronzed
from exposure on rocks, not scorched by sun-reflecting
snow; his boots scored with multitudinous little cuts
and scratches telling of difficult climbing; his hands
as brown as his face; his finger-nails, it must be
admitted, seriously impaired in their symmetry.
</p>

<p>
<q>And who is this? Has he been guilty of some
crime?</q> the old man asks.
</p>

<p>
<q>Not so,</q> the answer comes; <q>he has just
com<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>pleted the thousandth ascent of the Aiguille...;
he comes of a curious race which, history relates, at
one time much frequented these districts; but that
was a great while ago—long before the monarchy
was re-established. You do well to look at him; that
is the last of the climbing Englishmen. They always
seem depressed when they have succeeded in achieving
their ambition of the moment; it is a characteristic of
their now almost extinct race.</q>
</p>

<note place="margin">Mountaineering in the future</note>

<p>
<q>And what about the perils of the expedition?</q>
the old man asks, brightening up a little as if some
old ideas had suddenly flashed across his mind. <q>I
would fain know whether the journey is different now
from what it was formerly; yet the heroes would mock
me, perchance, if I were to interrogate them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not at all,</q> the youth replies. <q>There are but
few of the first party who would not vouchsafe to give
you a full account, and might even in their courtesy
embellish the narrative with flowers of rhetoric. But
it is unnecessary. They will print a detailed and full
description of their exploits. It has all been said
before, but so has everything else, I think.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That is true,</q> the old man murmurs to himself; <q>it
was even so in my time, and two hundred years before
I lived a French writer commenced his book with the
remark, <q><hi rend='italic'>Tout est dit.</hi></q> But what of the other, the
dejected survivor? does he not too write?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes, indeed, but not in the same strain; he will
<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/>but pour out a little gentle sarcasm and native spleen,
in mild criticism of the fulsome periods he peruses in
other tongues.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah me!</q> thinks the old man, <q>in one respect then
I need not prove so much behind the time. If the
memory of the Alpine literature of my day were still
fresh, I could hold mine own with those I see around.</q>
</p>

<p>
May I be permitted, in conclusion, to come back
to our own day, and to say a very few words on the
subject of mountaineering accidents? Most heartily
would I concur with any one who raised the objection
that such remarks are out of place in a chapter on
the mountaineering of the future. But perhaps we
have been looking too far ahead, and there may be a
period to follow between this our time and the future
to be hoped for.
</p>

<note place="margin">Dangers of the Alps</note>

<p>
It has sometimes been stated and written that no
one desires to remove from mountaineering all danger.
The dangers of mountaineering have been divided by
a well-known authority into real and imaginary. The
supposed existence of the latter is, I grant, desirable,
especially to the inexperienced climber; but I shall
always contend that it ought to be the great object of
every votary of the pursuit to minimise the former to
the utmost of his ability. Now, it is only by true
experience—that is, by learning gradually the art of
mountaineering—that the climber will achieve this
result. Few of those unacquainted with the subject
<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>can have any idea of the extraordinary difference
between the risk run on a difficult expedition (that is,
on one where difficulties occur: the name of the peak
or pass has little to do with the matter) by a practised
mountaineer who has learned something of the art,
and an inexperienced climber who has nothing but
the best intentions to assist his steps. The man of
experience bears always in mind the simple axioms
and rules of his craft; if he does not he is a bad
mountaineer. If the plain truth be told, accidents in
the Alps have almost invariably, to whomsoever they
befell, been due to breaking one or more of these
same well-known rules, or, in other words, to bad
mountaineering. That such is no more than a simple
statement of fact a former president of the Alpine
Club, Mr. C. E. Mathews, has abundantly proved.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Vide</hi> <hi rend="italic">Alpine Journal</hi>, vol. xi. p. 78. <q>The Alpine Obituary,</q>
by C. E. Mathews.</note>
Numbers of our countrymen, young and old, annually
rush out to the Alps for the first time. Fired with
ambition, or led on by the fascination of the pastime,
with scarcely any preliminary training and no preliminary
study of the subject, they at once begin to
attack the more difficult peaks and passes. Success
perhaps attends their efforts. Unfit, they go up a
difficult mountain, trusting practically to the ability
of the guides to do their employers’ share of the work
as well as their own. They descend, and think to gauge
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>their skill by the name of the expedition undertaken.
The state of the weather and of the mountain determine
whether such a performance be an act of simple
or of culpable folly. For such the imaginary dangers
are the most formidable. If they had taken the
trouble to begin at the beginning, to learn the difference
between the stem and stern of a boat before
attempting to navigate an ironclad, they would have
recognised, and profited by, the true risks run. As
it is, they are probably inflated with conceit at overcoming
visionary difficulties. They may make, indeed,
in this way what in Alpine slang is called a good
<q>book;</q> but by far the greater number fail to perceive
that there is anything to learn. It is a pastime—an
amusement; they do not look beyond this.
But these same climbers would admit that in other
forms of sport, such as cricket or rowing, proficiency
is not found in beginners. It is in the study and
development of the amusement that the true and
deeper pleasure is to be found. A tyro in cricket
would make himself an object of ridicule in a high-class
match; the novice in the art of rowing would
be loth to display his feeble powers if thrust into a
racing four with three tried oarsmen; and yet the
embryo climber can see nothing absurd in attacking
mountains of recognised difficulty. Inexperience in
the former instances at least could cause no harm,
while ignorance of the elementary principles of
moun<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>taineering renders the climber a serious source of
danger not only to himself but to others. There is
no royal road to the acquirement of mountaineering
knowledge. It is just as difficult to use the axe or
alpenstock properly as the oar or the racquet; just
as much patient, persevering practice is needed; but
it is not on difficult expeditions that such inexperience
can be best overcome.
</p>

<note place="margin">The real mountaineer</note>

<p>
A man of average activity could, probably, actually
climb, without any particular experience, most of, or
all, the more difficult rock peaks under good conditions
of weather and the like. But how different from the
really practical mountaineer, who strives to make an
art of his pastime. Watch the latter. First and
foremost, he knows when to turn back, and does not
hesitate to act as his judgment directs. He bears in
mind that there is pleasure to be obtained from
mountaineering even though the programme may not
be carried out in its entirety as planned, and realises
to the full that
</p>

<lg>
<l>’Tis better to have climbed and failed</l>
<l>Than never to have climbed at all.</l>
</lg>

<p>
His companions are always safe with him, his climbing
unselfish; he never dislodges a loose stone—except
purposely—either with hands, feet, or the loose
rope; he is always as firm as circumstances will
permit, prepared to withstand any sudden slip; he
never puts forth more strength at each step than is
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>necessary, thus saving his powers, being always ready
in an emergency, and never degenerating into that
most dangerous of encumbrances, a tired member of
a united party: not, of course, that the vast majority
of amateurs can ever hope, with their imperfect
practice, to attain to the level of even a second-rate
guide; still, by bringing his intelligence to bear on
this, as he does on any other amusement, the
amateur can render himself something more than
a thoroughly reliable companion on any justifiable
expedition.
</p>

<note place="margin">Conclusion</note>

<p>
Let the spirit of competition lead young climbers
to strive after excellence in this direction, rather than,
as is too commonly the case, induce them to take
<q>Times</q> as the criterion of mountaineering proficiency.
There are instructors enough. Even from
an inferior guide an infinite amount may be learnt;
at the least such a one can recognise the real danger
of the Alps, and in this respect possesses a faculty
which is one of the chief the mountaineer has to
acquire. Let the spirit in which the Alps are climbed
be of some such nature as that I have attempted to
indicate, and accidents such as those recorded in
Mr. C. E. Mathews’ grim list will be of such rare
occurrence that they will never be called up to discredit
mountaineering. If, perchance, any words
here written shall prompt in the future the climber
to perfect his art more and more while frequenting
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>the old haunts, and to extend and utilise mountaineering
still more, then at least the writer may feel, like
the mountain when it had brought forth the ridiculous
mouse, that his labour has not been wholly in vain.
Yet more: his gloomy forebodings shall be falsified,
and with respect to the future of mountaineering the
outlook will be bright enough.
